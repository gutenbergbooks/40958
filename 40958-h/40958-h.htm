<span class="sc">Construction of Vessels.</span>&#8212;As merchant vessels of the larger
class are now built in the United States, the extreme length of deck,
from the after part of the stern-post to the fore part of the stem, is
from four and a half to four and three fourths that of the beam, at its
widest part. The Damascus, of 700 tons' measurement, built at Boston in
1839, and considered a fair specimen of our best freighting vessels,
had 150 feet from stem to stern-post, and 32 feet 6 inches extreme
breadth. The Rajah, of 530 tons, built at Boston in 1837, had 140 feet
length, and 30 feet beam;&#8212;being each in length about four and six
tenths their beam.
</p>

<p>
A great contrast to this proportion is exhibited in the most recent
statistics (1841) of vessels of the same tonnage in the English navy;
as the following table will show.

These may, perhaps, be considered the extremes of ship-building; and
between these there is every grade of difference.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Tonnage and Carriage of Merchant Vessels.</span>&#8212;The amount a vessel
will carry in proportion to her tonnage, depends upon whether, and to
what extent, she is full or sharp built. A sharp-built vessel of 300
tons' measurement, will carry just about her tonnage of measurement
goods. A sharp-built vessel of 200 tons or under would probably carry
less than her measurement; if over 400 tons, she would increase
gradually to fifty per cent. above her measurement. A sharp-built
vessel of 600 tons, is generally rated at 900 tons carriage. A
full-built vessel of 300 tons, after the latest model of American
freighting vessels, will carry 525 tons, or seventy-five per cent.
above her measurement; and one of 500 tons would carry full double her
measurement.
</p>

<p>
The following table may give a pretty fair average.

<span class="sc">Proportions of Spars.</span>&#8212;There is no particular rule for
sparring merchant vessels; some being light, and others heavy sparred;
and some having long topmasts and short lower masts, and others the
reverse. The prevailing custom now is, to spar them lightly; the main
yard being a little less than double the beam; and the others
proportioned by the main. Most merchant vessels now have the yards at
the fore and main of the same size, for convenience in shifting sails;
so that the same topsail may be bent on either yard.
</p>

<p>
The following table, taken from the "Seamen's Manual," will show the
average proportions of the spars of merchant vessels of the largest
class, as formerly built.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Main-mast, two and a half times the ship's beam.</li>
<li>Fore-mast, eight ninths of the main-mast.</li>
<li>Mizzen-mast, five sixths of the main-mast.</li>
<li>Bowsprit, two thirds of the main-mast.</li>
<li>Topmasts, three fifths of the lower masts.</li>
<li>Topgallant masts, one half the length of their topmasts.</li>
<li>Jib-boom, the length of the bowsprit.</li>
<li>Main-yard, twice the beam.</li>
<li>Fore-yard, seven eighths of the main-yard.</li>
<li>Maintopsail-yard, two thirds of the main-yard.</li>
<li>Foretopsail-yard, two thirds of the fore-yard.</li>
<li>Crossjack-yard, the length of the maintopsail-yard.</li>
<li>Topgallant-yards, two thirds of the topsail-yards.</li>
<li>Mizzentopsail-yard, the length of the maintopgallant-yard.</li>
<li>Royal-yards, two thirds of the topgallant-yards.</li>
<li>Spritsail-yard, five sixths of the foretopsail-yard.</li>
<li>Spanker-boom, the length of the maintopsail-yard.</li>
<li>Spanker-gaff, two thirds of the boom.</li>
</ul>

<p>
For the thickness of the spars, the same book allows for the lower
masts one inch and a quarter diameter at the partners, for every three
feet of length; and nine tenths in the middle and two thirds under the
hounds, for every inch at the partners. For the yards, one inch at the
slings, and half an inch at the yard-arms, within the squares, for
every four feet of the length. For the breadth of the maintop, one half
of the beam, and of the foretop, eight ninths of the maintop.

<p>
<span class="sc">Placing the Masts.</span>&#8212;For a full-built ship, take the ship's
extreme length and divide it into sevenths. Place the foremast one
seventh of this length from the stem; the mainmast three sevenths from
the foremast, and the mizzenmast two sevenths from the mainmast. If a
vessel is sharp-built, and her stem and stern-post rake, her foremast
should be further aft, and her mizzenmast further forward, than the
rule of sevenths would give. A common rule for placing the foremast, is
to deduct three fifths of a ship's beam from her length, for the
curvature of the keel forward, which is called the <i>keel-stroke</i>,
and place the mast next abaft the keel-stroke.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Size of Anchors and Cables.</span>&#8212;Various rules have been adopted
for the weight of a ship's anchors. A vessel of 100 tons will generally
have a best bower of 6 cwt. and a small bower of 5 cwt.; the weight of
both being eleven pounds to a ton of the vessel. As a vessel increases
in size, the proportion diminishes. A vessel of 700 tons will usually
carry a best bower of 27 cwt. and a small bower of 24 cwt.; the weight
of both being seven and a half pounds to a ton of the vessel. The
<i>stream</i> should be a little more than one third the weight of the
best bower. The anchor-stock should be the length of the shank; its
diameter should be half that of the ring, and its thickness one inch at
the middle and half an inch at each end for every foot in length. Chain
cables are usually ninety fathoms in length, for large-sized vessels,
and sixty for small vessels, as schooners and sloops. The regulation of
the United States Navy for chain cables, is one inch and a half for a
sloop of war, and one and a quarter for brigs and schooners. In the
merchant service, a ship of 400 tons would probably have a best bower
cable of one and five sixths, and a working bower of one and a quarter
inches. A ship of 700 tons would have a best bower of one and five
eighths, and a working bower of one and a half inches. Chain cables
have a shackle at every fifteen fathoms, and one swivel at the first
shackle. Some have two swivels; and formerly they were made with a
swivel between each shackle.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Lead-lines.</span>&#8212;The <i>hand-lead</i> weighs usually seven pounds,
and the hand-line is from twenty to thirty fathoms in length. The
<i>deep-sea-lead</i> (pro. dipsey) weighs from fourteen to eighteen or
twenty pounds; and the deep-sea-line is from ninety to one hundred and
ten fathoms. The proper way to mark a hand-line is, black leather at 2
and 3 fathoms; white rag at 5; red rag at 7; wide strip of leather,
with a hole in it, at 10; and 13, 15 and 17 marked like 3, 5 and 7; two
knots at 20; 3 at 30; and 4 at 40; with single pieces of cord at 25 and
35.
</p>

<p>
The deep-sea-line has one knot at 20 fathoms, and an additional knot at
every 10 fathoms, with single knots at each intermediate 5 fathoms. It
sometimes has a strip of leather at 10 fathoms, and from 3 to 10 is
marked like the hand-line.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Log-line.</span>&#8212;The rate of a ship's sailing is measured by a
log-line and a half-minute glass. The line is marked with a knot for
each mile; the real distance between each knot being, however, <span class="smc">1/120</span> of
a mile, since a half-minute is <span class="smc">1/120</span> of an hour. A knot being thus the
same portion of a mile that a half-minute is of an hour, the number of
knots carried off while the glass is running out will show the number
of miles the vessel goes in an hour. Many glasses, however, are made
for twenty-eight seconds, which, of course, reduces the number of feet
for a knot to forty-seven and six tenths. But as the line is liable to
stretch and the glass to be affected by the weather, in order to avoid
all danger of a vessel's overrunning her reckoning, and to be on the
safe side, it is recommended to mark forty-five feet to a knot for a
twenty-eight second glass. About ten fathoms is left unmarked next the
chip, called <i>stray-line</i>. The object of this is that the chip may
get out of the eddy under the stern, before the measuring begins. The
end of the stray-line is marked by a white rag, and the first knot is
forty-five or forty-seven feet from the rag. A single piece of cord or
twine is put into the line for the first knot, one knot for the second,
two for the fourth, three for the sixth, and so on, a single piece of
cord being put in at the intermediate knots.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Ballast and Lading.</span>&#8212;A ship's behavior, as the phrase is,
depends as much upon the manner in which she is loaded and ballasted,
as upon her model. It is said that a vessel may be prevented from
rolling heavily, if, when the ballast is iron, it is stowed up to the
floor-heads; because this will bring the ship back, after she has
inclined, with less violence, and will act upon a point but little
distant from the centre of gravity, and not interfere with her stiff
carrying of sail. The cargo should be stowed with the weightier
materials as near as possible to the centre of gravity, and high or
low, according to the build of the vessel. If the vessel is full and
low built, the heavy articles should be stowed high up, that the centre
of gravity may be raised and the vessel kept from rolling too much, and
from being too laborsome. But a narrow, high-built vessel should have
the heavy articles stowed low and near the keelson, which will tend to
keep her from being crank, and enable her to carry sail to more
advantage.

CUTTING AND FITTING STANDING RIGGING.
</p>

<p class="subhead">
Measuring and cutting lower rigging and lower fore-and-aft stays.
Fitting the same. Measuring, cutting, and fitting topmast rigging,
stays, and backstays. Jib, topgallant, and royal stays. Rattling down
rigging. Cutting and fitting lifts, foot-ropes, brace-block straps, and
pennants. Breast-backstays.
</p>


<p>
<span class="sc">Cutting lower Rigging.</span>&#8212;Draw a line from the side of the
partners abreast of the mast, on the deck, parallel to the channels,
and to extend as far aft as they do. On this line mark the places of
each dead-eye, corresponding to their places against the channels. Send
a line up to the mast-head, and fasten it to the mast by a nail above
the bibbs, in a range with the centre of the mast, and opposite to the
side the channel line is drawn upon. Then take the bight of the line
around the forward part of the mast, and fasten it to the mast by a
nail, opposite the first nail, so that the part between the nails will
be half the circumference of the mast-head; then take the line down to
the mark on the channel line for the forward dead-eye, and mark it as
before; and so on, until you have got the distance between the mast and
each mark on the channel line. Now cast off the line from the
mast-head, and the distance between the end of the line and each mark
will give you the length of each shroud from the lower part of the
mast-head. And, to make an allowance for one pair of shrouds overlaying
another, you may increase the length of the pair put on second, that
is, the larboard forward ones, by twice the diameter of the rigging;
the third pair by four times; and so on.
</p>

<p>
The size of the lower rigging should be as much as eight and a half
inches for vessels of seven or eight hundred tons, and from seven and a
half to eight for smaller vessels, over three hundred tons.
</p>

<p>
For the length of the fore, main, and mizzen stays and spring-stays,
take the distance from the after part of the mast-head to their hearts,
or to the place where they are set up, adding once the length of the
mast-head for the collar.
</p>

<p>
The standing stays should be once and half the circumference of the
shrouds.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Fitting lower Rigging.</span>&#8212;Get it on a stretch, and divide each
pair of shrouds into thirds, and mark the centre of the middle third.
Tar, worm, parcel and serve the middle third. Parcel <i>with</i> the
lay of the rope, working toward the centre; and serve <i>against</i>
the lay, beginning where you left off parcelling. Serve as taut as
possible. In some vessels the outer thirds of the swifters are served;
but matting and battens are neater and more generally used.
</p>

<p>
Formerly the middle third was parcelled over the service, below the
wake of the futtock staff. Mark an eye at the centre of the middle
third, by seizing the parts together with a round seizing. The eye of
the pair of shrouds that goes on first should be once and a quarter the
circumference of the mast-head; and make each of the others in
succession the breadth of a seizing larger than the one below it.
Parcel the score of the dead-eye, and heave the shroud taut round it,
turning in <i>with</i> the sun, if right-hand-laid rope, and
<i>against</i> the sun, if hawser-laid; then pass the throat seizing
with nine or ten turns, the outer turns being slacker than the middle
ones. Pass the quarter seizings half way to the end, and then the end
seizings, and cap the shroud, well tarred under the cap. Make a Matthew
Walker knot in one end of the lanyard, reeve the other end <i>out</i>
through the dead-eye of the shroud, beginning at the side of the
dead-eye upon which the end of the shroud comes, and <i>in</i> through
the dead-eye in the channels, so that the hauling part of the lanyard
may come in-board and on the same side with the standing part of the
shroud. If the shroud is right-hand-laid rope, the standing part of the
shroud will be aft on the starboard, and forward on the larboard side;
and the reverse, if hawser-laid.
</p>

<p>
The neatest way of setting up the lower fore-and-aft stays, is by
reeving them <i>down</i> through a bull's eye, with tarred parcelling
upon the thimble, and setting them up on their ends, with three or four
seizings. The collar of the stay is the length of the mast-head, and is
leathered over the service. The service should go beyond the wake of
the foot of the topsail, and the main-stay should be served in the wake
of the foremast. The main and spring stays usually pass on different
sides of the foremast, and set up at the hawse-pieces.
</p>

<p>
The bolsters under the eyes of the rigging should always be covered
with tarred parcelling, marled on.
</p>

<p>
The starboard forward shroud goes on first; then the larboard; and so
on. The fore stay and spring stay go over the shrouds; and the head
stays always go over the backstays.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Cutting and fitting Topmast Rigging.</span>&#8212;For the forward shroud,
measure from the hounds of the topmast down to the after part of the
lower trestle-trees, and add to that length half the circumference of
the mast-head at the hounds. The eye is once and a quarter the
circumference of the mast-head. The topmast rigging in size should be
three fifths of the lower rigging. For the topmast backstays, measure
the distance from the hounds of the mast down to the centre of the
deck, abreast of their dead-eyes in the channels, and add to this
length one half the circumference of the mast-head. Add to the length
of the larboard pair, which goes on last, twice the diameter of the
rope. The size of the fore and main topmast backstays is generally one
quarter less than that of the lower rigging; and that of the mizzen
topmast backstays the same as that of the main topmast rigging. The
size of the topmast stays should be once and a quarter that of the
rigging. The topmast rigging is fitted in the same manner as the lower.
The backstays should be leathered in the wake of the tops and lower
yards. The breast-backstays are turned in upon blocks instead of
dead-eyes, and set up with a luff purchase. The fore topmast stay sets
up on the starboard, and the spring stay on the larboard side of the
bowsprit.
</p>

<p>
All the fore-and-aft stays are now set up on their ends, and should be
leathered in their nips, as well as in their eyes.
</p>

<p>
The main topmast stay goes through a heart or thimble at the
foremast-head, or through a hole in the cap, and sets up on deck or in
the top; and the mizzen topmast stay sets up at the mainmast-head,
above the rigging.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jib, Topgallant, and Royal Rigging.</span>&#8212;The jib stay sets up on
its end on the larboard side of the head, and is served ten feet from
the boom, and its collar is leathered like that of the topmast stay.
The gaub lines or back ropes go from the martingale in-board. The guys
are fitted in pairs, rove through straps or snatches on the spritsail
yard, and set up to eye-bolts inside of or abaft the cat-heads. The
foot-ropes are three quarters the length of the whole boom, and go over
the boom-end with a cut splice. Overhand knots or Turks-heads should be
taken in them at equal distances, to prevent the men from slipping,
when laying out upon them.
</p>

<p>
The most usual method of fitting topgallant rigging in merchantmen, is
to reeve it through holes in the horns of the cross-trees, then pass it
between the topmast shrouds over the futtock staff, and set it up at an
iron band round the topmast, just below the sheave-hole; or else down
into the top, and set it up there. To get the length of the starboard
forward shroud, measure from the topgallant mast-head to the heel of
the topmast, and add one half the circumference of the topgallant
mast-head. Its size should be about five sevenths of the topmast
rigging. Each pair of shrouds should be served below the futtock
staves. They are fitted like the topmast shrouds. The fore-and-aft
stays of long topgallant masts go with eyes, and are served and
leathered in the wake of the foot of the sails. The fore topgallant
stay leads in on the starboard side of the bowsprit, and sets up to a
bolt at the hawse-piece; the main leads through a chock on the after
part of the fore topmast cross-trees, and sets up in the top; and the
mizzen usually through a thimble on the main cap, and sets up on its
end.
</p>

<p>
The topgallant backstays set up on their end, or with lanyards in the
channels; and for their length, measure from the mast-head to the
centre of the deck, abreast the bolt in the channels.
</p>

<p>
The royal shrouds, backstays, and fore-and-aft stays, are fitted like
those of the topgallant masts, and bear the same proportion to them
that the topgallant bear to the topmast. The fore royal stay reeves
through the outer sheave-hole of the flying jib-boom, and comes in on
the larboard side; the main through a thimble at the fore
jack-cross-trees; and the mizzen through a thimble at the maintopmast
cap. The flying jib-stay goes in on the starboard side, and sets up
like the jib-stay. The gear of the flying jib-boom is fitted like that
of the jib-boom.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Ratling.</span>&#8212;Swift the rigging well in, and lash handspikes or
boat's oars outside at convenient distances, parallel with the
shear-pole. Splice a small eye in the end of the ratlin, and seize it
with yarns to the after shroud on the starboard side and to the forward
on the larboard, so that the hitches may go <i>with</i> the sun. Take a
clove hitch round each shroud, hauling well taut, and seize the eye of
the other end to the shroud. The ratlins of the lower rigging should be
thirteen, and of the topmast rigging eleven inches apart, and all
square with the shear-pole.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Standing Rigging of the Yards.</span>&#8212;The first thing to go upon the
lower yard-arm, next the shoulder, is the head-earing strap; the next,
the foot-ropes; next, the brace-block; and lastly, the lift. The
foot-ropes go with an eye over the yard-arm, are rove through thimbles
in the end of the stirrups, (sometimes with Turks-heads, to prevent
their slipping,) and are lashed to bolts or thimbles, but now usually
to the iron trusses. The stirrups fit to staples in the yard, with an
eye-splice. The lifts should be single, and fitted with an eye over the
yard-arm, and lead through a single block at the mast-head, and set up
by a gun or luff tackle purchase, with the double block hooked to a
thimble or turned in at the end, and the lower block to an eye-bolt in
the deck. Instead of brace-blocks on the fore and main yards,
brace-pennants fitted over the yard-arm with an eye are neater. The
latest and neatest style of rigging lower yards is to have a strong
iron band with eyes and thimbles round each yard-arm, close to the
shoulder; and then fit the lift, foot-rope, and brace-pennant, each to
one of these eyes, with an eye-splice round the thimble or with a hook.
The lower lifts now, for the most part, cross each other over a saddle
upon the cap, instead of going through blocks.
</p>

<p>
The inner ends of the foot-ropes to the topsail, topgallant and royal
yards, cross each other at the slings; and on the topsail yard there
are Flemish-horses, spliced round thimbles on the boom-iron, and the
other end seized to the yard, crossing the foot-rope. A neater mode is
to hook the outer end of the Flemish-horse, so that it may be unhooked
and furled in with the sails when in port. Next to the foot-ropes go on
the brace-blocks, and lastly, the lifts. The rigging to the topgallant
and royal yards is fitted similarly to that upon the topsail, except
that there is nothing over the yard-arms but foot-rope, brace and lift.
The brace to the royal yard fits with an eye. The reef-tackle,
studding-sail halyard, and other temporary blocks, are seized to the
lower and topsail yard-arms by open straps, so that they may be removed
without taking off the lift. The topgallant studding-sail halyard block
is often hooked to the boom-iron, under the yard.
</p>

<p>
The foot-ropes to the spanker-boom should be half the length of the
boom, going over the end with a splice, covered with canvass, and
coming in one third of the way to the jaws, and seized to the boom by a
rose-seizing through an eye-splice. The next to go over the boom-end
are the guys, which are fitted with a cut-splice covered with canvass,
and have a single block turned in at their other ends. To these single
blocks are luff or gun-tackle purchases, going to the main
brace-bumpkin. Their length should be two fifths that of the boom. The
topping-lifts are usually hooked into a band or spliced into bolts
about one quarter the distance from the outer end of the boom, and
reeve through single blocks under the top, with a double or single
block at their lower ends.
</p>

<p>
All the splices and seizings of the standing rigging should be covered
with canvass, if possible, except in the channels and about the head,
where they are too much exposed to the washing of water. A vessel looks
much neater for having the ends of the rigging, where eyes are spliced,
or where they are set up on their ends aloft or on deck, covered with
canvass, and painted white or black, according to the place where they
are. The lanyards and dead-eyes of the smaller rigging which sets up in
the top may also be covered with canvass. The lanyards, dead-eyes, and
turnings-in of the rigging in the channels, should always be protected
by scotchmen when at sea, and the forward shroud should be matted or
battened all the way up to the futtock staves.
</p>

<p>
In some smaller merchantmen the lower rigging is not infrequently set
up upon its end to bolts in the rail. This is very inconvenient on many
accounts, especially as all the seizings have to be come up with, and
the nip of the shroud altered, whenever it is at all necessary to set
them taut. This soon defaces and wears out the ends; while, with
dead-eyes, only the lanyards have to be come up with. Some vessels set
up their lower rigging with dead-eyes upon the rail. This is convenient
in setting them up in bad weather, but does not give so much spread as
when set up in the channels, and presents a more complicated surface to
the eye. If the rigging is fitted in this way, you must deduct the
height of the rail above the deck from the measure before given for
cutting it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Breast-backstays.</span>&#8212;It is not usual, now, for merchant vessels
to carry topmast breast-backstays. If they are carried, they are spread
by out-riggers from the top. Topgallant and royal breast-backstays are
used, and are of great assistance in sailing on the wind. There are
various ways of rigging them out, of which the following is suggested
as a neat and convenient one. Have a spar fitted for an out-rigger,
about the size of one of the horns of the cross-trees, with three holes
bored in it, two near to one end, and the third a little the other side
of the middle. Place it upon the after horn of the cross-tree, with the
last-mentioned hole over the hole in the end of the horn of the
cross-tree, and let the after topgallant shroud reeve through it. Reeve
the topgallant and royal breast-backstays through the outer holes, and
set them up by a gun-tackle purchase, in the channels.<a href="#note1" name="noteref1">
<small>[1]</small></a> The inner end
of the out-rigger should fit to a cleat, and be lashed to the
cross-tree by a lanyard. When the breast-backstays are to be rigged in,
cast off the lanyard, and let the out-rigger slue round the topgallant
shroud for a pivot, the inner end going aft, and the outer end, with
the backstays, resting against the forward shroud. One of these
out-riggers should be fitted on each side, and all trouble of shifting
over, and rigging out by purchase, will be avoided.

</p>


<p>
To reeve a brace, begin on deck, and reeve to where the standing part
is made fast. The <i>fore braces</i> reeve <i>up</i> through a block on
the mainmast just below the rigging, <i>down</i> or <i>in</i> through
the brace-block on the yard or at the end of the pennant, and the
standing part is brought through the cheeks of the mast with a knot
inside. The neatest way for reeving the <i>main brace</i> is <i>out</i>
through a single block on the brace-bumpkin, <i>out</i> through the
brace-pennant-block, <i>in</i> through an outer block on the bumpkin,
and seized to the strap of the pennant. Another way is <i>out</i>
through the bumpkin block, <i>out</i> or <i>down</i> through the
pennant block, and secure the end to the bumpkin or to the
fashion-piece below.
</p>

<p>
The <i>cross-jack braces</i> reeve <i>up</i> through blocks on the
after shroud of the main rigging, <i>up</i> through blocks on the yard,
one third of the way in from the yard-arm, and are seized to a bolt in
the mainmast, or to the after shroud again.
</p>

<p>
The <i>fore topsail braces</i> reeve <i>up</i> through the blocks
secured to the bibbs at the mainmast-head, <i>in</i> through the
span-block at the collar of the main stay, <i>up</i> through the block
on the yard, and are seized to the main topmast-head; or else <i>up</i>
through a block at the topmast-head, down through the brace-block on
the yard, and are seized to the collar of the main stay. The last way
is the best. The <i>main topsail braces</i> are rove through
span-blocks at the mizzen-mast, below the top, <i>up</i> through the
blocks on the yard, and are seized to the mizzen topmast-head; or else
<i>up</i> through a block at the mizzen-mast-head, <i>down</i> through
the block on the yard, and secured to the mizzen-mast. The first way is
the best. The <i>mizzen topsail braces</i> reeve <i>up</i> through the
leading blocks or fair-leaders on the main rigging, <i>up</i> through
blocks at the mainmast-head, or at the after part of the top, <i>up</i>
through the yard blocks, and are seized to the cap.
</p>

<p>
The <i>fore</i> and <i>main topgallant braces</i> are rove <i>up</i>
through blocks under the topmast cross-trees, <i>in</i> through
span-blocks on the topmast stays, just below their collars, <i>up</i>
through the blocks on the yards, and the main are usually seized to the
head of the mizzen topgallant mast, and the fore to the topmast stay,
by the span-block. The <i>mizzen topgallant braces</i> generally go
single, through a block at the after part of the main top-mast
cross-trees. The <i>royal braces</i> go single: the <i>fore</i>,
through a block at the main topgallant mast-head; the <i>main</i>,
through one at the mizzen topgallant mast-head; and the <i>mizzen</i>,
through a block at the after part of the main topmast cross-trees.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Halyards.</span>&#8212;The <i>lower yards</i> are now hung by patent iron
trusses, which allow the yard to be moved in any direction; topped up
or braced. The <i>topsail yards</i> have chain tyes, which are hooked
to the slings of the yard, and rove through the sheave-hole at the
mast-head. The other end of the tye hooks to a block. Through this
block a chain runner leads, with its standing part hooked to an
eye-bolt in the trestle-tree, and with the upper halyard-block hooked
to its other end. The halyards should be a luff purchase, the fly-block
being the double block, and the single block being hooked in the
channels. Sometimes they are a gun-tackle purchase, with two large
single blocks. The lower block of the mizzen topsail halyards is
usually in the mizzen-top, the fall coming down on deck.
</p>

<p>
The <i>fore</i> and <i>mizzen topsail halyards</i> come down to port,
and the main to the starboard. The <i>topgallant halyards</i> come down
on opposite sides from the topsail halyards; though the fore and main
usually come down by the side of the masts. The fore and main
topgallant halyards sometimes hoist with a gun-tackle purchase, but the
mizzen and all the royal halyards are single.
</p>

<p>
The <i>throat and peak halyards</i> of the spanker are fitted in the
following manner. The outer peak halyard block is put on the gaff, one
third of its length from the outer end, or a very little, if any,
within the leech of the sail; and the inner one, two thirds in. The
blocks are fitted round the gaff with grommet straps, and are kept in
their places by cleats. The double block of the peak halyards is
strapped to the bolt in the after part of the mizzen cap, and the
halyards are rove <i>up</i> through this, <i>in</i> through the blocks
on the gaff, the inner one first, the standing part made fast to the
double block, and the fall coming on deck. The upper block of the
throat halyards is secured under the cap, and the lower block is hooked
to an eye-bolt on the jaws of the gaff. This is a two-fold tackle.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">The Spanker Brails.</span>&#8212;The <i>peak brails</i> reeve through
single blocks on the gaff, two on each side, generally span-blocks, and
then through the throat brail blocks, as leaders, to the deck. The
<i>throat brails</i> reeve through two triple blocks strapped to
eye-bolts under the jaws of the gaff, one on each side, through the two
other sheaves of which the peak brails lead. Each brail is a single
rope, middled at the leech of the sail.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Tacks, Sheets, Clewlines, &#38;c.</span>&#8212;It is much more convenient to
have the tack and sheet blocks of the courses fastened to the clews of
the courses by hooks. Then they can be unhooked when the sail is
furled, and, in light weather, a single rope with a hook, called a
<i>lazy sheet</i>, can be used, instead of the heavy tacks and sheets
with their blocks. This is also much more convenient in clewing up. The
<i>main tack</i> is rove <i>aft</i> through the block in the waterways,
<i>forward</i> through the block on the sail, and the standing part
hooks to the block on deck. The <i>fore tack</i> goes through a block
on the bumpkin. The <i>sheets</i> of the courses have the after block
hooked to an eye-bolt in the side, abaft the channels, and the forward
one hooked to the clew of the sail, the running part reeving through a
sheave-hole in the rail. The sheets of all the square sails but the
courses run from the clew of the sail, through sheave-holes in the
yard-arms, through the quarter blocks, down on deck. The <i>topsail
sheets</i> are chain, are clasped to the clews of the sail, and are
fitted with a gun-tackle purchase at the foot of the mast. The
<i>topgallant</i> and <i>royal sheets</i> are single. The
<i>topsail</i> and <i>topgallant clewlines</i> reeve through the
quarter-blocks. The <i>royal clewlines</i> are single, and the topsail
and topgallant are a gun-tackle purchase.
</p>

<p>
The <i>reef-tackles</i> of the topsails reeve <i>up</i> through blocks
on the lower rigging, or futtock shrouds, <i>down</i> through the block
on the yard, down the leech of the sail and through the block on the
leech, and are made fast to the yard on their own parts, with a clinch,
outside of everything.
</p>

<p>
The <i>clew-garnets</i> reeve <i>out</i> through blocks under the
quarters of the yard, then <i>up</i> through blocks at the clew, and
the standing part is made fast to the yard, to the block, or to a
strap. The <i>buntlines</i> of the courses reeve through double or
triple blocks under the forward part of the top, down forward of the
sail, sometimes through thimbles in the first reef-band, and are
clinched to the foot of the sail. The <i>leechlines</i> reeve through
single blocks on the yard, and are clinched to the leech of the sail.
The <i>slabline</i> is a small rope rove through a block under the
slings of the yard, and clinched to the foot of the sail. This is not
much used in merchant vessels. The <i>topsail clewlines</i> lead like
the clew-garnets of the courses. The <i>topsail buntlines</i> reeve
forward through single blocks at the topmast-head, down through the
thimbles of a lizard seized to the tye, just above the yard, and are
clinched to the foot of the sail. The handiest way of reeving the
<i>main bowline</i> is to have a single rope with the standing part
hooked near the foremast, and reeve it <i>out</i> through a heart in
the bridle. This will answer for both sides. The <i>fore bowline</i>
may be rove through a single block at the heel of the jib-boom and
hooked to the bridle. The bowlines to the other sails are toggled to
the bridles and lead forward. Many vessels now dispense with all the
bowlines except to the courses. This saves trouble, makes a ship look
neater, and, if the sails are well cut, they will set taut enough in
the leach, without bowlines.

<p>
<span class="sc">Taking in Lower Masts and Bowsprit.</span>&#8212;Shore up the beams upon
which the heels of the shears will rest, if necessary, from the
keelson. Parbuckle the shears aboard, with their heads aft. Raise their
heads upon the taffrail, cross them, and pass the shear-lashing. Lash
the upper block of a three-fold tackle under the cross, and secure the
lower block to the breast-hooks, or to a toggle in the hawse-hole. You
may also reeve and secure, in the same manner, a smaller purchase,
which shall work clear of the first. Have two forward and two after
guys clove-hitched to the shear-head, with cleats to prevent their
slipping. Get a girt-line on one shear-head and a small tackle on the
other, to slue and cant the mast. Let the fall of the main tackle come
through the middle sheave, to prevent the block's sluing in its strap.
Reeve large heel tackles to rouse the shears aft with. Put long oak
plank shoes under the heels; and, if it be necessary, clap a
thwart-ship tackle upon the two heels, or reeve a lashing, and put a
stout plank between them, and bowse taut; which will prevent too great
a strain coming upon the water-ways. Take the main tackle fall to the
capstan; heave round, haul on the forward guy and after heel tackles,
and raise the shear to an angle of about eighty degrees with the deck,
and so that the main purchase will hang plumb with the partners of the
mizzen-mast. Lash a garland to the forward part of the mast, above the
centre, and toggle the purchase to it. Heave the mast in over the
bulwarks; fit the trestle-trees and after chock; reeve girt-lines by
which men may be hoisted when the mast is in; point the mast in, and
lower away. Always take in the mizzen-mast first. Get in the main and
then the foremast in the same manner, rousing the shears forward, with
their shoes, by means of the heel tackles. Having stepped and secured
the foremast, carry the forward guys aft and rake the shears over the
bows; toggle the lower block of the main tackle to a garland lashed to
the upper part of the bowsprit inside of the centre. Put on the cap,
and carry tackles or guys from the bowsprit-head to each cat-head, and
clap on a heel tackle or guy. Heave the bowsprit, and direct it by the
small tackles and guys.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To rig a Bowsprit</span>.&#8212;Lash collars for the fore stay, bobstays,
and bowsprit shrouds, then for the spring stay, and put on the bees for
the topmast stays; fit the man-ropes, pass the gammoning, and set up
bobstays and shrouds.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To get the Tops over the Mast-heads</span>.&#8212;Place the top on deck
abaft the mast; get a girt-line on each side of the mast-head, and pass
the end of each under the top, through the holes in the after part;
clinch them to their own parts, and stop them to the fore part of the
top with slip-stops. Have a guy to the fore and another to the after
part of the top. Make the ends of a span fast to the after corners of
the top, and bend a girt-line from the mast-head to the bight of the
span, and stop it to the forward part of the top. Sway away on the
girt-lines. When the fore part of the top is above the trestle-trees,
cut the span-stops, and when the after part is above them, cast off the
slip-stops. When the lubber-hole is high enough to clear the mast-head,
haul on the forward guy, and let the top hang horizontally by the
girt-lines. Lower away, place and bolt it.
</p>

<p>
The fore and main tops are sent up from abaft, and the mizzen from
forward. The tops may be got over without the span and girt-line, by
stopping the two girt-lines first rove to the middle as well as to the
fore part of the top, and cutting the upper stops first.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To send up a Topmast</span>.&#8212;Get the topmast alongside, with its
head forward. Lash a top-block to the head of the lower-mast; reeve a
mast-rope through it, from aft forward, and bring the end down and
reeve it through the sheave-hole of the topmast, hitching it to its own
part a little below the topmast-head, and stopping both parts to the
mast, at intervals. Snatch the rope and sway away. As soon as the head
is through the lower cap, cast off the end of the mast-rope, letting
the mast hang by the stops, and hitch it to the staple in the other end
of the cap. Cast off the stops and sway away. Point the head of the
mast between the trestle-trees and through the hole in the lower cap,
the round hole of which must be put over the square hole of the
trestle-trees. Lash the cap to the mast, hoist away, and when high
enough, lower a little and secure the cap to the lower mast-head. (This
is when it cannot be put on by hand.) If the cross-trees are heavy,
they may be placed in the following manner. Sway away until the
topmast-head is a few feet above the lower cap. Send up the cross-trees
by girt-lines, and let the after part rest on the lower cap and the
forward part against the topmast. Lower away the topmast until the
cross-trees fall into their place, and then hoist until they rest on
the shoulders. Lash on the bolsters, get girt-lines on the cross-trees
to send up the rigging, and then put it over the mast-head, first the
shrouds, then the backstays, and lastly the head-stays. Sway the
topmast on end, fid it, and set up the rigging.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To get on a Topmast-Cap.</span>&#8212;In vessels of the largest class, it
may be necessary to send up the cap in the following manner, but it can
usually be got up by hand. Or it may be fitted and the rigging put on
over it. Send the cap up to the cross-trees by girt-lines, and place
the round hole of the cap over the forward hole of the cross-trees;
send aloft a topgallant studdingsail boom, and point its upper end
through the holes in the cross-trees and cap, and lash the cap to it.
Hook a tackle or girt-line to a strap on the lower end of the spar, and
sway away until the cap is over the mast-head. Slue the spar so that
the cap may come fair, lower away, and place the cap upon the
mast-head. Unlash the spar and send it down.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To rig out a Jib-boom.</span>&#8212;Point the outer end through the
collars of the stays. Reeve the heel-rope through a block at the
bowsprit cap, through the sheave-hole at the heel of the boom, and
secure the end to an eye-bolt in the cap on the opposite side. Rig the
boom out until the inner sheave-hole is clear of the cap. Tar the
boom-end, put on the foot-ropes and guys, and reeve the jib stay. Hoist
up the martingale and rig it, and reeve the martingale stay and
gaub-line. Rig the boom out to its place, and set up the jib and
martingale stays.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To cross a Lower Yard.</span>&#8212;If the yard is alongside, reeve the
yard rope through the jear block at the mast-head, make it fast to the
slings of the yard, and stop it out to the yard-arm. Sway away, and
cast off the stops as the yard comes over the side, and get the yard
across the bulwarks. Lower yards are rigged now with iron trusses and
quarter-blocks, which would be fitted before rigging the yard. Seize on
the clew-garnet block, and put the rigging over the yard-arm; first the
straps for the head-earings, then the foot-ropes, then the brace blocks
or pennants, and last the eye of the lift. (The lifts, brace pennants,
and foot-ropes are now spliced or hooked into rings with thimbles on an
iron band, round the yard-arm, next the shoulders. In this way, there
is no rope of any kind round the yard-arm.) Reeve the lifts and braces,
get two large tackles from the mast-head to the quarters of the yard,
and sway away on them and on the lifts, bearing off and sluing the yard
by means of guys. Secure the yard by the iron trusses, and haul taut
lifts and braces.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To cross a Topsail Yard.</span>&#8212;As topsail yards now have chain
tyes, there are no tye-blocks to seize on. The quarter-blocks are first
seized on, and the parral secured at one end, ready to be passed. A
single parral has an eye in each end, and one end is passed under the
yard and over, and the eye seized to the standing part, close to the
yard. After the yard is crossed, the other end is passed round the
mast, then round the yard, and seized in the same manner. To pass a
double parral, proceed in the same manner, except that the seizings are
passed so as to leave the eyes clear and above the standing part, and
then take a short rope with an eye in each end, pass it round the mast,
and seize the eyes to the eyes of the first long rope. The parral is
wormed, served and leathered. The parral being seized at one end, put
on the head-earing straps, the foot-ropes, Flemish horses, and brace
blocks. Bend the yard-rope to the slings, stop it out to the yard-arm,
and sway away until the yard is up and down; then put on the upper lift
in the top and the lower lift on deck, and reeve the braces. Sway away,
cast off the stops, and take in upon the lower lift as the yard rises,
till the yard is square; then haul taut lifts and braces and pass the
parral.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To send up a Topgallant Mast.</span>&#8212;Most merchantmen carry <i>long
topgallant masts</i>. In these, the topgallant, royal and skysail masts
are all one stick. <i>A short topgallant mast</i> is one which has
cross-trees, and above which a fidded royal-mast may be rigged. <i>A
stump topgallant mast</i> has no cross-trees, or means for setting a
mast above it, and is carried only in bad weather. Some short
topgallant masts are rigged with a <i>withe</i> on the after part of
the mast-head, through which a sliding-gunter royal-mast is run up,
with its heel resting in a step on the topmast cap.
</p>

<p>
To send up a long topgallant mast, put the jack over the topmast cap,
with a grommet upon its funnel for the eyes of the rigging to rest
upon; send up the rigging by girtlines, and put the eyes over the jack,
first the topgallant shrouds, backstays and stays, then the royal
rigging in the same order, with a grommet, then the skysail stay and
backstay, and lastly the truck. Reeve a top-rope forward through a
block at the topmast-head, through the hole in the cross-trees; through
the sheave-hole at the foot of the topgallant mast; carry it up the
other side, and make it fast to its own part at the mast-head; stop it
along the mast, and bend a guy to the heel. Sway away, and point
through the jack; put on the truck, and the skysail, royal and
topgallant rigging in their order; slue the mast so as to bring the
sheaves of the tyes fore-and-aft; cast off the end of the top-rope, the
mast hanging by the stops; make it fast to an eye-bolt on the starboard
side of the cap, and sway away. When high enough, fid the mast and set
up the rigging.
</p>

<p>
A short topgallant mast is sent up like a topmast, the cross-trees got
over in the same manner; and the fidded royal-mast is sent up like a
long topgallant mast.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To rig out a Flying Jib-boom.</span>&#8212;Ship the withe on the jib-boom
end, reeve a heel-rope through a block at the jib-boom end, and bend it
to the heel of the flying jib-boom, and stop it along, out to the end.
Haul out on the heel-rope, point through the withe, put on the rigging,
in the same order with that of the jib-boom; reeve the guys,
martingale, flying jib, royal and skysail stays; rig out, and set up
the rigging. The heel of the boom rests against the bowsprit cap, and
is lashed to the jib-boom.
</p>

<p>
The flying jib-boom should be rigged fully out before the fore
topgallant mast is swayed on end.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To cross a Topgallant Yard.</span>&#8212;Seize on the parral and
quarter-blocks; reeve the yard-rope through the sheave-hole of the
topgallant mast, make it fast to the slings of the yard, and stop it
out to the upper end. Sway away, and when the upper yard-arm has
reached the topmast-head, put on the upper lift and brace; sway away
again, put on the lower lift and brace, cast off all the stops, settle
the yard down square by lifts and braces, and pass the parral lashing.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To cross Royal Yards.</span>&#8212;The royal yards are crossed in the same
manner as the topgallant yards, except that in most merchantmen they
would be sent up by the halyards instead of a yard-rope. If there is
not a standing skysail, the quarter-blocks on the royal yard will be
single.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Skysail Yards.</span>&#8212;If the skysail is a standing sail, the yard is
rigged like the royal yard, with lifts and braces, and the sail is
fitted with sheets and clewlines; but if it is a flying skysail, the
yard has neither lifts nor braces, and the clews of the sail are seized
out to the royal yard-arms. There are various ways of rigging a flying
skysail, of which the following is believed to be as convenient as any.
Let the royal stay go round the mast-head, with a traveller, above the
yard, so that the stay may travel up and down the skysail mast. Seize a
thimble into the stay, close against the forward part of the grommet;
lead the skysail halyards through the thimble, and make them fast to
the centre of the yard, which will need no parral, underneath the royal
stay. Make fast the ends of two small ropes for downhauls, to the
skysail yard, about half way out on each yard-arm, and reeve them
through small cleats on the after part of the royal yard, the same
distance out on each yard-arm. These may be spliced into a single rope
below the yard, which will go through a fair-leader in the cross-trees
to the deck. By this means the skysail may be taken in or set without
the necessity of sending a man aloft. Let go the halyards and haul on
the downhaul, and the yard will be brought close down to the royal
yard. To hoist it, let go the downhaul and royal stay, and haul on the
halyards. When the royal is taken in, haul the skysail yard down with
the royal yard, and furl the sail in with the royal.

TO SEND DOWN MASTS AND YARDS.
</p>

<p class="subhead">
To send down a royal yard&#8212;a topgallant yard&#8212;a topgallant mast. To
house a topgallant mast. To send down a topmast. To rig in a jib boom.
</p>


<p>
<span class="sc">To send down a Royal Yard.</span>&#8212;If the sail is bent to the yard,
furl it, making the gaskets fast to the tye. Cast off the sheets and
clewlines, and make them fast to the jack. Be careful to unreeve the
clewlines through the quarter-blocks. Cast off the parral-lashing.
Overhaul the tye a little, and stop it to the yard, just outside of the
quarter-block. If stopped too far out, the yard will not hoist high
enough to get the lower lift off. Sway away on the halyards, which will
cant the yard and hoist it. When high enough, cast off the lower lift
and brace, (being careful not to let the brace go,) and make them fast
to the jack. Lower away, and as the upper yard-arm comes abreast of the
jack, clap a stop round the yard and tye, near the yard-arm, and cast
off the lift and brace, making them fast to the jack. Lower away to the
deck.
</p>

<p>
If the halyards are not single, the yard must be sent down by a
yard-rope, like the topgallant yard. In some vessels, instead of making
the sheets and clewlines fast to the jack, overhand knots are taken in
their ends, and they are let go. The sheets will run out to the
topgallant yard-arms, and the clewlines will run to the fair-leaders in
the cross-trees. In port, the main royal yard is sent down on the
starboard side, and the fore and mizzen on the larboard; but at sea,
the tye is stopped out on the lee side, and the yard sent down in any
way that is the most convenient.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To send down a Topgallant Yard.</span>&#8212;Cast off the sheets,
bowlines, buntlines and clewlines, and make them fast to the
cross-trees. Reeve a yard-rope through a jack-block at the mast-head,
unhook the tye, cast off the parral-lashing, bend the yard-rope to the
slings of the yard by a fisherman's bend, and stop it to the quarters
of the yard. Sway away, and take off the lifts and braces, as with the
royal yard.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To send down a Topgallant Mast.</span>&#8212;Hook the top-block to the
eye-bolt at the larboard side of the topmast cap; reeve the mast-rope
through it, then through the sheave-hole in the foot of the topgallant
mast, and hitch its end to the eye-bolt on the starboard side of the
cap. Come up the rigging, stays and backstays, and guy the mast-head by
them. Hoist a little on the mast-rope, and take out the fid. (The fid
should always be fastened to the cross-trees or trestle-trees, by a
lanyard.) Lower away until the mast is a little short of being through
the cap. Then seize or rack together both parts of the mast-rope just
above the sheave-hole; cast off the end of the mast-rope, letting the
mast hang by the stops, and hitch it round the mast-head to its own
part, below the cap. Then lower away to the deck. If the rigging is to
come on deck, round up the mast-rope for a girtline; if it is to remain
aloft, lash it to the topmast cap, render the shrouds through the
cross-trees, and stop them up and down the topgallant rigging.
Sheep-shank the stays and backstays, and set them hand-taut. If the
top-mast is also to be sent down, take off the topmast cap and send it
on deck.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To house a Topgallant Mast.</span>&#8212;Proceed in the same manner,
except that when the mast is low enough, belay the mast-rope, pass a
heel-lashing through the fid-hole and round the topmast.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To send down a Topmast.</span>&#8212;Hook the top-block, reeve the
mast-rope through it and through the sheave-hole in the foot of the
mast, and hitch it to the staple at the other side of the cap. Lead the
fall through a snatch-block, to the capstan. Sling the lower yard, if
it is to remain aloft, and unshackle the trusses, if they are of iron.
Come up the rigging, stays and backstays, weigh the mast, take out the
fid, and lower away. If the rigging is to remain aloft, lash the
cross-trees to the lower cap. The rigging should be stowed away snugly
in the top, and the backstays be snaked up and down the lower rigging.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To rig in a Jib-boom.</span>&#8212;Reeve the heel-rope (if necessary,)
come up the stay, martingale stay and guys; unreeve the jib-stay,
station hands at each guy, clear away the heel-lashing, haul in upon
the guys, and light the boom on board. In most cases the boom will come
in without a heel-rope. Make fast the eyes of the rigging to the
bowsprit cap, and haul all taut.

BENDING AND UNBENDING SAILS.
</p>

<p class="subhead">
To bend a course. To send up a topsail by the halyards&#8212;by the
bunt-lines. To bend a topgallant sail&#8212;a royal&#8212;a jib&#8212;a spanker&#8212;a
spencer. To unbend a course&#8212;a topsail&#8212;a topgallant sail or royal&#8212;a
jib. To send down a topsail or course in a gale of wind. To bend a
topsail in a gale of wind. To bend one topsail or course, and send down
the other at the same time.
</p>


<p>
<span class="sc">To bend a Course.</span>&#8212;Stretch the sail across the deck, forward
of the mast and under the yard; being careful to have the after part of
the sail aft. Seize the clew-garnet blocks to the clews; also the tack
and sheet blocks, unless they go with hooks or clasps. Reeve the
buntlines through the thimbles of the first reef-band forward, if they
are made to go so, and toggle their ends to the foot of the sail, or
carry them through the eyelet-holes and clinch them to their own parts.
Reeve the clew-garnets and leechlines; carry the bights of the
buntlines under the sail, and rack them to their own parts; stop the
head of the sail to the buntlines below the rackings; put robands to
each eyelet-hole in the head of the sail; fasten the head and reef
earings to their cringles, reeving the end of the reef-earings through
the head-cringle and taking a bowline with them to their standing
parts, and hitching the head-earings to the buntlines. Sway away on the
buntlines, leechlines and clew-garnets; when the sail is up, pass the
head-earings, reeving <i>aft</i> through the straps on the yard, and
<i>forward</i> through the head cringle. Haul out on the earings,
making the sail square by the glut, and pass the earings round the
yard, over and under, through the head-cringle at each turn, and make
the end fast around the first turns. If the sail is new, ride down the
head rope on the yard, and freshen the earings. Make fast the head of
the sail to the jack-stay by robands, and cast the stops off the
buntlines.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To bend a Topsail.</span>&#8212;Make fast the head and reef-earings to
their cringles, passing the end of each reef-earing through the cringle
above its own and making it fast by a bowline to its own part. Put
robands to each eyelet-hole in the head. If the sail is to be sent up
by the topsail halyards, lay it on deck abaft the foot of the mast,
make it up with its head and foot together, having the head and first
reef cringles together and out, and also the bowline cringle and the
clews out. Bight the sail in three parts on a pair of slings, having
the end of the sail that belongs on the opposite yard-arm on top. Have
the fly-block of the topsail halyards above the top, and rack the
runner to the topmast backstay or after shroud. Hook the lower block to
the slings around the sail, hoist the sail up into the top, cast off
the slings, unhook the halyards, and pass the upper end of the sail
round forward of the mast, ready for bending. (If the vessel is rolling
or pitching, with a stiff breeze, the sail may be guyed and steadied as
it goes up, by hooking a snatch-block, moused, to the slings around the
sail, passing the hauling part of the halyards through it, and through
another snatch-block on deck.) Get the clewlines, buntlines, sheets,
bowlines, and reef-tackles ready for bending, the clove hooks of the
sheets being stopped to the topmast rigging. Hook or clasp the sheets
to the clews, reeve the clewlines and reef-tackles, toggle the
bowlines, clinch or toggle the buntlines to the foot of the sail, and
stop the head to the buntlines. Hoist on the buntlines and haul out on
the reef-tackles, bringing the sail to the yard, and then pass the
head-earings and make fast the robands as for a course. If the sail is
to be sent up by the buntlines, lay the sail on the deck and forward of
the mast, overhaul the buntlines down forward of the yard, on each side
of the topmast stay and on the same side of the lower stay. Clinch the
ends to the foot of the sail, bight them around under the sail and rack
the bights to their standing parts, and stop the head of the sail to
the standing parts below the rackings. Bend one bowline to the centre
of the sail, to guy it in going aloft. Have the earings bent and
secured as before described, and the bights of the head-earings hitched
to the buntlines. Sway it up to the top, and haul the ends in on each
side of the mast; reeve the clewlines and reef-tackles, make fast the
bowlines and sheets, the ends of which, if chain, should be racked to
the topmast rigging, ready to be made fast to the clews. The gear being
bent, hoist on the buntlines, haul out on the reef-tackles, pass the
head-earings, cut the stops of the buntlines, and make fast the
robands. Middle the sail on the yard by the glut, or by the centre
cringle.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To bend Topgallant Sails and Royals.</span>&#8212;These are generally bent
to their yards on deck; the royals always. After being bent to the
yard, they are furled, with their clews out, ready for sending aloft.
If the topgallant sail is to be bent aloft, send it up to the topmast
cross-trees by the clewlines, or by the royal halyards; and there bend
on the sheets, clewlines, buntlines and bowlines, and bring the sail to
the yard as with a topsail.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To bend a Jib.</span>&#8212;Bend the jib halyards round the body of the
sail, and the downhaul to the tack. Haul out on the downhaul, hoisting
and lowering on the halyards. Seize the tack to the boom, the hanks to
the luff of the sail, and the halyards to its head. Reeve the downhaul
up through the hanks and make it fast to the head of the sail. Seize
the middle of the sheet-pennant to the clew.
</p>

<p>
In some vessels the hanks are first seized to the sail, and the
jib-stay unrove, brought in-board, and passed down through the hanks,
as the sail is sent out, rove in its place and set up. This is more
troublesome, and wears out the jib-stay.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To bend a Spanker.</span>&#8212;Lower the gaff, and reeve the throat-rope
through the hole in the gaff under the jaws, and secure it. Sometimes
the head of the luff fits with a hook. Then haul out the head of the
sail by the peak-earing, which is passed like the head-earing of a
topsail. When the head-rope is taut, pass the lacings through the
eyelet-holes, and round the jack-stay. Seize the bights of the throat
and peak brails to the leech, at distances from the peak which will
admit of the sail's being brailed up taut along the gaff, and reeve
them through their blocks on the gaff, and at the jaws, on each side of
the sail. The foot brail is seized to the leech just above the clew.
Seize the luff of the sail to the hoops or hanks around the spanker
mast, beginning with the upper hoop and hoisting the gaff as they are
secured. The tack is hooked or seized to the boom or to the mast. Hook
on the outhaul tackle. This is usually fitted with an eye round the
boom, rove through a single block at the clew, and then through a
sheave-hole in the boom.
</p>

<p>
Some spankers are bent with a peak outhaul; the head traversing on the
jack-stay of the gaff.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">The Fore and Main Spencers</span> are bent like the spanker, except
that they have no boom, the clew being hauled aft by a sheet, which is
generally a gun-tackle purchase, hooked to an eye-bolt in the deck.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To unbend a Course.</span>&#8212;Haul it up, cast off the robands, and
make the buntlines fast round the sail. Ease the earings off together,
and lower away by the buntlines and clew-garnets. At sea, the lee
earing is cast off first, rousing in the lee body of the sail, and
securing it by the earing to the buntlines.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To unbend a Topsail.</span>&#8212;Clew it up, cast off the robands, secure
the buntlines round the sail, unhook the sheets, and unreeve the
clewlines and reef-tackles; ease off the earings, and lower by the
buntlines.
</p>

<p>
A <i>top gallant sail</i> is unbent in the same manner, and sent down
by the buntlines. A <i>royal</i> is usually sent down with the yard.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To unbend a Jib.</span>&#8212;Haul it down, cast off the hank seizings and
the tack-lashing, cast off and unreeve the downhaul and make it fast
round the sail, and cast off the sheet-pennant lashings. Haul aboard by
the downhaul, hoisting clear by the halyards.
</p>

<p>
The rules above given are for a vessel in port, with squared yards. If
you are at sea and it is blowing fresh, and the topsail or course is
reefed, to send it down, you must cast off a few robands and
reef-points, and pass good stops around the sail; then secure the
buntlines also around it, and cast off all the robands, reef-points and
reef-earings. Bend a line to the lee head-earing and let it go, haul
the sail well up to windward, and make fast the lee earing to the
buntlines. Get a hauling line to the deck, forward; ease off the
weather earing, and lower away.
</p>

<p>
To bend a new topsail in a gale of wind, it has been found convenient
to make the sail up with the reef-bands together, the points all being
out fair, to pass several good stops round the sail, and send up as
before. This will present less surface to the wind. One course may be
sent up as the other goes down, by unbending the buntlines from the
foot of the old sail, passing them down between the head of the sail
and the yard, bending them to the foot of the new sail, and making the
new sail up to be sent aloft by them, as before directed. Run the new
sail up to the yard abaft the old one, and send the old one down by the
leechlines and the head-earings, bent to the topmast studdingsail
halyards, or some other convenient rope.
</p>

<p>
One topsail may be sent up by the topsail halyards, got ready for
bending, and brought to the yard, while the old one is sent down by the
buntlines.

<p>
Those ropes in a ship which are stationary are called <i>standing
rigging</i>, as shrouds, stays, backstays, &#38;c. Those which reeve
through blocks or sheave-holes, and are hauled and let go, are called
the <i>running rigging</i>, as braces, halyards, buntlines, clewlines,
&#38;c.
</p>

<p>
A rope is composed of threads of hemp, or other stuff. These threads
are called <i>yarns</i>. A number of these yarns twisted together form
a <i>strand</i>, and three or more strands twisted together form the
rope.
</p>

<p>
The ropes in ordinary use on board a vessel are composed of three
strands, laid <span class="sc">RIGHT HANDED</span>, (1.) or, as it is called, <i>with
the sun</i>. Occasionally a piece of large rope will be found laid up
in four strands, also <i>with</i> the sun. This is generally used for
standing rigging, tacks, sheets, &#38;c., and is sometimes called
<i>shroud-laid</i>.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">A cable-laid Rope</span> (2.) is composed of nine strands, and is
made by first laying them into three ropes of three strands each,
<i>with</i> the sun, and then laying the three ropes up together into
one, left-handed, or <i>against</i> the sun. Thus, cable-laid rope is
like three small common ropes laid up into one large one. Formerly, the
ordinary three-stranded right-hand rope was called <i>hawser-laid</i>,
and the latter <i>cable-laid</i>, and they will be found so
distinguished in the books; but among sea-faring men now, the terms
<i>hawser-laid</i> and <i>cable-laid</i> are applied indiscriminately
to nine-strand rope, and the three stranded, being the usual and
ordinary kind of rope, has no particular name, or is called right-hand
rope.
</p>

<p>
Right-hand rope must be coiled <i>with</i> the sun, and cable-laid rope
<i>against</i> the sun.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Spunyarn</span> is made by twisting together two or more yarns taken
from old standing rigging, and is called two-yarn or three-yarn
spunyarn, according to the number of yarns of which it is composed.
Junk, or old rigging, is first unlaid into strands, and then into
yarns, and the best of these yarns made up into spunyarn, which is used
for worming, serving, seizing, &#38;c. Every merchant vessel carries a
spunyarn-winch, for the manufacturing of this stuff, and in making it,
the wheel is turned <i>against</i> the sun, which lays the stuff up
with the sun.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Worming</span> a rope, is filling up the divisions between the
strands, by passing spunyarn along them, to render the surface smooth
for parcelling and serving.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Parcelling</span> a rope is wrapping narrow strips of canvass about
it, well tarred, in order to secure it from being injured by rain-water
lodging between the parts of the service when worn. The parcelling is
put on <i>with</i> the lay of the rope.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Service</span> is the laying on of spunyarn, or other small stuff, in
turns round the rope, close together, and hove taut by the use of a
serving-board for small rope, and serving-mallet for large rope. Small
ropes are sometimes served without being wormed, as the crevices
between the strands are not large enough to make the surface very
uneven; but a large rope is always wormed and parcelled before being
served. The service is put on <i>against</i> the lay of the rope.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Splicing</span>, is putting the ends of ropes together by opening the
strands and placing them into one another, or by putting the strands of
the ends of a rope between those of the bight.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">A Short Splice.</span> (3.) Unlay the strands for a convenient
length; then take an end in each hand, place them one within the other,
and draw them close. Hold the end of one rope and the three strands
which come from the opposite rope fast in the left hand, or, if the
rope be large, stop them down to it with a rope-yarn. Take the middle
strand, which is free, pass it <i>over</i> the strand which is first
next to it, and through <i>under</i> the second, and out between the
second and third from it, and haul it taut. Pass each of the six
strands in the same manner; first those on one side, and then those on
the other. The same operation may be repeated with each strand, passing
each <i>over</i> the third from it, and <i>under</i> the fourth, and
through; or, as is more usual, after the ends have been stuck once,
untwist each strand, divide the yarns, pass one half as above
described, and cut off the other half. This tapers the splice.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">A Long Splice.</span> (4.) Unlay the ends of two ropes to a distance
three or four times greater than for a short splice, and place them
within one another as for a short splice. Unlay one strand for a
considerable distance, and fill up the interval which it leaves with
the opposite strand from the other rope, and twist the ends of these
two together. Then do the same with two more strands. The two remaining
strands are twisted together in the place where they were first
crossed. Open the two last named strands, divide in two, take an
overhand knot with the opposite halves, and lead the ends over the next
strand and through the second, as the whole strands were passed for the
short splice. Cut off the other two halves. Do the same with the others
that are placed together, dividing, knotting, and passing them in the
same manner. Before cutting off any of the half strands, the rope
should be got well upon a stretch. Sometimes the whole strands are
knotted then divided, and the half strands passed as above described.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">An Eye Splice.</span> (5.) Unlay the end of a rope for a short
distance, and lay the three strands upon the standing part, so as to
form an eye. Put one end through the strand next to it. Put the next
end over that strand and through the second; and put the remaining end
through the third strand, on the other side of the rope. Taper them, as
in the short splice, by dividing the strands and sticking them again.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">A Flemish Eye.</span> (6.) Take the end of a rope and unlay one
strand. Form an eye by placing the two remaining ends against the
standing part. Pass the strand which has been unlaid over the end and
in the intervals round the eye, until it returns down the standing
part, and lies under the eye with the strands. The ends are then
scraped down, tapered, marled, and served over with spunyarn.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">An artificial or Spindle Eye.</span>&#8212;Unlay the end of a rope and
open the strands, separating each rope yarn. Take a piece of wood, the
size of the intended eye, and hitch the yarns round it. Scrape them
down, marl, parcel, and serve them. This is now usually called a
<span class="sc">Flemish Eye</span>.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">A Cut Splice.</span> (7.) Cut a rope in two, unlay each end as for a
short splice, and place the ends of each rope against the standing part
of the other, forming an oblong eye, of the size you wish. Then pass
the ends through the strands of the standing parts, as for a short
splice.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">A Grommet.</span> (8.) Take a strand just unlaid from a rope, with
all its turns in it, and form a ring of the size you wish, by putting
the end over the standing part. Then take the long end and carry it
twice round the ring, in the crevices, following the lay, until the
ring is complete. Then take an overhand knot with the two ends, divide
the yarns, and stick them as in a long splice.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">A single Wall Knot.</span> (9.) Unlay the end of a rope. Form a bight
with one strand, holding its end down to the standing part in your left
hand. Pass the end of the next strand round this strand. Pass the
remaining strand round the end of the second strand, and up through the
bight which was made by the first strand. Haul the ends taut carefully,
one by one.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">A single Wall, crowned.</span> (10.) Make the single wall as before,
and lay one end over the top of the knot. Lay the second end over the
first, and the third over the second and through the bight of the
first.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">A double Wall.</span> (11.) Make the single wall slack, and crown it,
as above. Then take one end, bring it underneath the part of the first
walling next to it, and push it up through the same bight. Do the same
with the other strands, pushing them up through two bights. Thus made,
it has a double wall and a single crown.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">A double Wall, double crowned.</span> (12.) Make the double wall,
single crowned, as above. Then lay the strands by the sides of those in
the single crown, pushing them through the same bight in the single
crown, and down through the double walling. This is sometimes called a
<span class="sc">Tack Knot</span>, or a <span class="sc">Topsail Sheet Knot</span>.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">A Matthew Walker Knot.</span> (13.) Unlay the end of a rope. Take one
strand round the rope and through its own bight; then the next strand
underneath, through the bight of the first, and through its own bight;
and the third strand underneath, through both the other bights, and
through its own bight.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">A single Diamond Knot.</span> (14.) Unlay the end of a rope for a
considerable distance, and with the strands form three bights down the
side of the rope, holding them fast with the left hand. Take the end of
one strand and pass it with the lay of the rope over the strand next to
it, and up through the bight of the third. Take the end of the second
strand over the third and up through the bight of the first. Take the
end of the third strand over the first and up through the bight of the
second. Haul taut, and lay the ends up together.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">A double Diamond Knot.</span> (15.) Make a single diamond, as above,
without laying the ends up. Follow the lead of the single knot through
two single bights, the ends coming out at the top of the knot. Lead the
last strand through two double bights. Haul taut, and lay the ends up.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">A Spritsail Sheet Knot.</span> (16.) Unlay two ends of a rope, and
place the two parts together. Make a bight with one strand. Wall the
six strands together, like a single walling made with three strands;
putting the second over the first, and the third over the second, and
so on, the sixth being passed over the fifth and through the bight of
the first. Then haul taut. It may be <i>crowned</i> by taking two
strands and laying them over the top of the knot, and passing the other
strands alternately over and under those two, hauling them taut. It may
be <i>double walled</i> by next passing the strands under the wallings
on the left of them, and through the small bights, when the ends will
come up for the second crowning; which is done by following the lead of
the single crowning, and pushing the ends through the single walling,
as with three strands, before described. This is often used for a
<i>stopper knot</i>.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">A Stopper Knot.</span>&#8212;Single wall and double wall, without
crowning, and stop the ends together.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">A Shroud Knot.</span>&#8212;Unlay the ends of two ropes, and place the
strands in one another, as for a short splice. Single wall the strands
of one rope round the standing part of the other, against the lay. Open
the ends, taper, marl, and serve them.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">A French Shroud Knot.</span>&#8212;Place the ends of two ropes as before.
Lay the ends of one rope back upon their own part, and single wall the
other three strands round the bights of the first three and the
standing part. Taper the ends, as before.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">A Buoy-rope Knot.</span>&#8212;Unlay the strands of a cable-laid rope, and
also the small strands of each large strand. Lay the large ones again
as before, leaving the small ones out. Single and double wall the small
strands (as for a stopper knot) round the rope, worm them along the
divisions, and stop their ends with spunyarn.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">A Turks-head.</span> (17.) This is worked upon a rope with a piece of
small line. Take a clove-hitch slack with the line round the rope. Then
take one of the bights formed by the clove-hitch and put it over the
other. Pass the end under, and up through the bight which is
underneath. Then cross the bights again, and put the end round again,
under, and up through the bight which is underneath. After this, follow
the lead, and it will make a turban, of three parts to each cross.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Two Half-hitches.</span> (18.) Pass the end of a rope round the
standing part and bring it up through the bight. This is a half-hitch.
Take it round again in the same manner for two half-hitches.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">A Clove-hitch</span> (19.) is made by passing the end of a rope round
a spar, over, and bringing it under and round behind its standing part,
over the spar again, and up through its own part. It may then, if
necessary, be stopped or hitched to its own part: the only difference
between two half-hitches and a clove-hitch being that one is hitched
round its own standing part, and the other is hitched round a spar or
another rope.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">An Overhand Knot.</span> (20.) Pass the end of a rope over the
standing part, and through the bight.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">A Figure-of-eight.</span> (21.) Pass the end of a rope over and round
the standing part, up over its own part, and down through the bight.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">A Bowline Knot.</span> (22.) Take the end of a rope in your right
hand, and the standing part in your left. Lay the end over the standing
part, and with the left hand make a bight of the standing part over it.
Take the end under the lower standing part, up over the cross, and down
through the bight.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">A Running Bowline.</span>&#8212;Take the end round the standing part, and
make a bowline upon its own part.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">A Bowline upon a Bight.</span> (23.) Middle a rope, taking the two
ends in your left hand, and the bight in your right. Lay the bight over
the ends, and proceed as in making a bowline, making a small bight with
your left hand of the ends, which are kept together, over the bight
which you hold in your right hand. Pass the bight in your right hand
round under the ends and up over the cross. So far, it is like a common
bowline, only made with double rope instead of single. Then open the
bight in your right hand and carry it over the large bights, letting
them go through it, and bring it up to the cross and haul taut.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">A Square Knot.</span> (24.) Take an overhand knot round a spar. Take
an end in each hand and cross them on the same side of the standing
part upon which they came up. Pass one end round the other, and bring
it up through the bight. This is sometimes called a REEF-KNOT. If the
ends are crossed the wrong way, sailors call it a GRANNY-KNOT.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">A Timber Hitch.</span> (25.) Take the end of a rope round a spar,
lead it under and over the standing part, and pass two or more
round-turns round its own part.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">A Rolling Hitch.</span>&#8212;Pass the end of a rope round a spar. Take it
round a second time, nearer to the standing part. Then carry it across
the standing part, over and round the spar, and up through the bight. A
strap or a tail-block is fastened to a rope by this hitch.
</p>

<p>
A bend, sometimes called a <i>rolling hitch</i>, is made by two
round-turns round a spar and two half-hitches round the standing part;
but the name is commonly applied to the former hitch.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">A Blackwall Hitch.</span> (26.) Form a bight by putting the end of a
rope across and under the standing part. Put the bight over the hook of
a tackle, letting the hook go through it, the centre of the bight
resting against the back of the hook, and the end jammed in the bight
of the hook, by the standing part of the rope.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">A Cat's Paw.</span> (27.) Make a large bight in a rope, and spread it
open, putting one hand at one part of the bight and the other at the
other, and letting the standing part and end come together. Turn the
bight over from you, three times, and a small bight will be formed in
each hand. Bring the two small bights together, and put the hook of a
tackle through them both.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">A Sheet Bend.</span> (28.) Pass the end of a rope up through the
bight of another, round both parts of the other, and under its own
part.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">A Fisherman's Bend.</span> (29.) Used for bending studdingsail
halyards to the yard. Take two turns round the yard with the end. Hitch
it round the standing part and both the turns. Then hitch it round the
standing part alone.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">A Carrick Bend.</span> (30.) Form a bight by putting the end of a
rope over its standing part. Take the end of a second rope and pass it
<i>under</i> the standing part of the first, <i>over</i> the end, and
<i>up</i> through the bight, <i>over</i> its own standing part, and
<i>down</i> through the bight again.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">A Bowline Bend.</span>&#8212;This is the most usual mode of bending warps,
and other long ropes or cables, together. Take a bowline in the end of
one rope, pass the end of the other through the bight, and take a
bowline with it upon its own standing part. Long lines are sometimes
bent together with half-hitches on their own standing parts, instead of
bowlines, and the ends seized strongly down.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">A Sheep-shank.</span> (31.) Make two long bights in a rope, which
shall overlay one another. Take a half-hitch over the end of each bight
with the standing part which is next to it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">A Selvagee.</span>&#8212;Lay rope yarns round and round in a bight, and
marl them down with spunyarn. These are used for neat block-straps, and
as straps to go round a spar for a tackle to hook into, for hoisting.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">A Marlinspike Hitch</span>&#8212;Lay the marlinspike upon the
seizing-stuff, and bring the end over the standing part so as to form a
bight. Lay this bight back over the standing part, putting the
marlinspike down through the bight, under the standing part, and up
through the bight again.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To pass a Round Seizing.</span>&#8212;Splice a small eye in the end of the
stuff, take the other end round both parts of the rope, and reeve it
through the eye. Pass a couple of turns, then take a marlinspike-hitch,
and heave them taut. Pass six, eight or ten turns in the same manner,
and heave them taut. Put the end through under these turns and bring it
out between the two last turns, or through the eye, and pass five,
seven or nine turns (one less than the lower ones) directly over these,
as riders. The riders are not hove so taut. Pass the end up through the
seizings, and take two cross turns round the whole seizing between the
two, passing the end through the last turn, and heaving taut. If the
seizing is small cordage, take a wall-knot in the end; if spunyarn, an
overhand knot. The cross turns are given up now in nearly all vessels.
After the riding turns are passed, the end is carried under the turns,
brought out at the other end, and made fast snugly to the standing part
of the rigging.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">A Throat Seizing</span>, where rigging is turned in, is passed and
made fast like the preceding, there being no cross turns. A neat way to
pass a throat seizing is to pass the turns rather slack, put a strap
upon the end of the rigging, take a handspike or heaver to it and bear
it down, driving home the seizing with a mallet and small fid.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Stopping</span>, is fastening two parts of a rope together as for a
round seizing, without a crossing.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Nippering</span>, is fastening them by taking turns crosswise between
the parts, to jam them; and sometimes with a round turn before each
cross. These are called <i>racking turns</i>. Pass <i>riders</i> over
these and fasten the end.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Pointing.</span>&#8212;Unlay the end of a rope and stop it. Take out as
many yarns as are necessary, and split each yarn in two, and take two
parts of different yarns and twist them up taut into <i>nettles</i>.
The rest of the yarns are combed down with a knife. Lay half the
nettles down upon the scraped part, the rest back upon the rope, and
pass three turns of twine taut round the part where the nettles
separate, and hitch the twine, which is called the <i>warp</i>. Lay the
nettles backwards and forwards as before, passing the warp, each time.
The ends may be whipped and snaked with twine, or the nettles hitched
over the warp and hauled taut. The upper seizing must be snaked. If the
upper part is too weak for pointing, put in a piece of stick.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Snaking</span> a seizing, is done by taking the end under and over
the outer turns of the seizing alternately, passing over the whole.
There should be a marline-hitch at each turn.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Grafting.</span>&#8212;Unlay the ends of two ropes and put them together
as for a short splice. Make nettles of the strands as before. Pass the
warp and nettles belonging to the lower strands along the rope, as in
pointing; then the nettles of the upper strands in the same manner.
Snake the seizing at each end.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Foxes</span> are made by twisting together three or more rope-yarns
by hand, and rubbing them hard with tarred canvass. <i>Spanish
foxes</i> are made of one rope-yarn, by unlaying it and laying it up
the other way.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gaskets.</span>&#8212;Take three or four foxes, middle them, and plait
them together into <i>sennit</i>. This is done by bringing the two
outside foxes alternately over to the middle. The outside ones are laid
with the right hand, and the remainder are held and steadied with the
left. Having plaited enough for an eye, bring all the parts together,
and work them all into one piece, in the same manner. Take out foxes at
proper intervals. When finished, one end must be laid up, the other
plaited, and the first hauled through. The name <i>sennit</i> is
generally given to rope yarns plaited in the same manner with these
foxes. Sennit made in this way must have an odd number of parts.
<span class="sc">French sennit</span> is made with an even number, taken over and
under every other time.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To bend a Buoy-rope.</span> Reeve the end through the eye in the
other end, put it over one arm of the anchor, and haul taut. Take a
hitch over the other arm. Or, take a clove-hitch over the crown,
stopping the end to its own part, or to the shank.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To pass a Shear-lashing.</span>&#8212;Middle the lashing and take a good
turn round both legs, at the cross. Pass one end up and the other down,
around and over the cross, until half of the lashing is expended. Then
ride both ends back again on their own parts and knot them in the
middle. Frap the first and riding turns together on each side with
sennit.

<p class="head">
BLOCKS AND PURCHASES.
</p>

<p class="subhead">
Parts of a block. Made and morticed blocks. Bull's-eye. Dead-eye.
Sister-block. Snatch-block. Tail-block. Whip. Gun-tackle. Luff-tackle.
Whip-upon-whip. Luff-upon-luff. Watch or tail-tackle. Runner-tackle.
</p>


<p>
Blocks are of two kinds, <i>made</i> and <i>morticed</i>. A <i>made
block</i> consists of four parts,&#8212;the <i>shell</i>, or outside; the
<i>sheave</i>, or wheel on which the rope turns; the <i>pin</i>, or
axle on which the wheel turns; and the <i>strap</i>, either of rope or
iron, which encircles the whole, and keeps it in its place. The sheave
is generally strengthened by letting in a piece of iron or brass at the
centre, called a <i>bush</i>.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">A Morticed Block</span> is made of a single block of wood, morticed
out to receive a sheave.
</p>

<p>
All blocks are single, double, or three-fold, according to the number
of sheaves in them.
</p>

<p>
There are some blocks that have no sheaves; as follows: a
<i>bull's-eye</i>, which is a wooden thimble without a sheave, having a
hole through the centre and a groove round it; and a <i>dead-eye</i>,
which is a solid block of wood made in a circular form, with a groove
round it, and three holes bored through it, for the lanyards to reeve
through.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">A Sister-block</span> is formed of one solid piece of wood, with two
sheaves, one above the other, and between the sheaves a score for the
middle seizing. These are oftener without sheaves than with.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Snatch-blocks</span> are single blocks, with a notch cut in one
cheek, just below the sheave, so as to receive the bight of a fall,
without the trouble of reeving and unreeving the whole. They are
generally iron-bound, and have a hook at one end.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">A Tail-block</span> is a single block, strapped with an eye-splice,
and having a long end left, by which to make the block fast temporarily
to the rigging. This tail is usually selvageed, or else the strands are
opened and laid up into sennit, as for a gasket.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">A Tackle</span> is a purchase formed by reeving a rope through two or
more blocks, for the purpose of hoisting.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">A Whip</span> is the smallest purchase, and is made by a rope rove
through one single block.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">A Gun-tackle Purchase</span> is a rope rove through two single blocks
and made fast to the strap of the upper block. The parts of all tackles
between the fasts and a sheave, are called the <i>standing parts</i>;
the parts between sheaves are called <i>running parts</i>; and the part
upon which you take hold in hoisting is called the <i>fall</i>.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">A Whip-upon-whip</span> is where the block of one whip is made fast
to the fall of another.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">A Luff-tackle Purchase</span> is a single and a double block; the end
of the rope being fast to the upper part of the single block, and the
fall coming from the double block. A luff-tackle upon the fall of
another luff-tackle is called <i>luff-upon-luff</i>.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">A Watch-tackle</span> or <span class="sc">Tail-tackle</span> is a luff-tackle
purchase, with a hook in the end of the single block, and a tail to the
upper end of the double block. One of these purchases, with a short
fall, is kept on deck, at hand, in merchant vessels, and is used to
clap upon standing and running rigging, and to get a strain upon ropes.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">A Runner-tackle</span> is a luff applied to a runner, which is a
single rope rove through a single block, hooked to a thimble in the eye
of a pennant.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">A Single Burton</span> is composed of two single blocks, with a hook
in the bight of the running part. Reeve the end of your rope through
the upper block, and make it fast to the strap of the fly-block. Then
make fast your hook to the bight of the rope, and reeve the other end
through the fly-block for a fall. The hook is made fast by passing the
bight of the rope through the eye of the hook and over the whole.

<small>[2]</small></a> When the gaskets
are cast off from both yard-arms, then let go the bunt gasket, (and
jigger, if there be one,) and overhaul the buntlines and leechlines. In
loosing a topsail in a gale of wind, it is better to cast off the

at the yard-arms. Royals and topgallant sails generally have one long
gasket to each yard-arm; in which case it is not necessary to go out
upon the yard, but the gaskets, after being cast off, should be
fastened to the tye by a bowline.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To set a Course.</span>&#8212;Loose the sail and overhaul the buntlines
and leechlines. Let go the clew-garnets and overhaul them, and haul
down on the sheets and tacks. If the ship is close-hauled, ease off the
lee brace, slack the weather lift and clew-garnet, and get the tack
well down to the water-ways. If it is blowing fresh and the ship
light-handed, take it to the windlass. When the tack is well down,
sharpen the yard up again by the brace, top it well up by the lift,
reeve and haul out the bowline, and haul the sheet aft.
</p>

<p>
If the wind is quartering, the mainsail is carried with the weather
clew hauled up and the sheet taken aft. With yards squared, the
mainsail is never carried, but the foresail may be to advantage,
especially if the swinging booms are out; in which case the heavy tack
and sheet-blocks may be unhooked, and the <i>lazy sheets</i> hooked on
and rove through a single tail-block, made fast out on the boom. This
serves to extend the clews, and is called a <i>pazaree</i> to the
foresail.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To set a Topsail.</span>&#8212;Loose the sail, and keep one hand in the
top to overhaul the rigging. Overhaul well the buntlines, clewlines,
and reef-tackles, let go the topgallant sheets and topsail braces, and
haul home on the sheets. Merchant vessels usually hoist a little on the
halyards, so as to clear the sail from the top, then belay them and get
the lee sheet chock home; then haul home the weather sheet, shivering
the sail by the braces to help it home, and hoist on the halyards until
the leeches are well taut, taking a turn with the braces, if the wind
is fresh, and slacking them as the yard goes up.
</p>

<p>
After the sail is set, it is sometimes necessary to get the sheets
closer home. Slack the halyards, lee brace, and weather bowline, clap
the watch-tackle upon the lee sheet first, and then the weather one,
shivering the sail by the braces if necessary. Overhaul the clewlines
and reef-tackles, slack the topgallant sheets, and hoist the sail up,
taut leech, by the halyards.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To set a Topgallant Sail or Royal.</span>&#8212;Haul home the lee sheet,
having one hand aloft to overhaul the clewlines, then the weather
sheet, and hoist up, taut leech, by the halyards. While hauling the
sheets home, if on the wind, brace up a little to shake the sail, take
a turn with the weather brace, and let go the lee one; if before the
wind, let go both braces; and if the wind is quartering, the lee one.

<p>
<span class="sc">To set a Spencer.</span>&#8212;Take the sheet to the deck on the lee side

</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To take in a Course.</span>&#8212;If the wind is light and there are hands
enough, let go the tack, sheet, and bowline, and haul up on the
clew-garnets, buntlines, and leechlines, being careful not to haul the
buntlines taut until the clews are well up. If light-handed, or the
wind fresh, let go the bowline and ease off the tack, (being careful to
let the bowline go before the tack,) and haul up the weather clew. Then
ease off the sheet and haul up on the lee clew-garnet, and the
buntlines and leechlines.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To take in a Topsail.</span>&#8212;The usual mode of taking in a topsail
when coming to anchor in light winds, is to lower away on the halyards
and haul down on the clewlines and reef-tackles, (if the latter run in
the way described in this book,) until the yard is down by the lifts,
rounding in on the weather brace, and hauling taut to leeward, when the
yard is square. Then let go the sheets and haul up on the clewlines and
buntlines. A better way is to start the sheets, clew about one third
up, then let go the halyards and take the slack in.
</p>

<p>
If the wind is fresh, and the yard braced up, lower away handsomely on
the halyards, get the yard down by the clewlines and reef-tackles,
rounding in on the weather brace, and steadying the yard by both
braces. Then let go the weather sheet and haul up to windward first.
The weather clew being up, let go the lee sheet and haul up by the
clewline and buntlines, keeping the clew in advance of the body of the
sail.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, if the weather brace cannot be well rounded in, as if a ship
is weak-handed, the sail may be clewed up to leeward a little, first.
In which case, ease off the lee sheet, and haul up on the clewline;
ease off the lee brace and round the yard in; and when the lee clew is
about half up, ease off the weather sheet and haul the weather clew
chock up. Haul the buntlines up after the weather clew, and steady the
yard by the braces. There is danger in clewing up to leeward first that
the sail may be shaken and jerked so as to split, before the weather
clew is up; whereas, if clewed up to windward first, the lee clew will
keep full, until the lee sheet is started.
</p>

<p>
When coming to anchor, it is the best plan to haul the clews about half
up before the halyards are let go.
</p>

<p>
In taking in a close-reefed topsail in a gale of wind, the most general
practice is to clew up to windward, keeping the sail full; then lower
away the halyards, and ease off the lee sheet; clew the yard down, and
haul up briskly on the lee clewline and the buntlines, bracing to the
wind the moment the lee sheet is started.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To take in a Topgallant Sail or Royal.</span>&#8212;If the wind is light,
and from aft or quartering, let go the halyards and clew down, squaring
the yard by the braces. Then start the sheets and clew up, and haul up
the buntlines. If the yard is braced up, the old style was to let go
the halyards, clew down and round in on the weather brace; clewing up
to windward first, then start the lee clew, and haul up the lee
clewline and the buntlines. But the practice now is to clew up to
leeward first, which prevents the slack of the sail getting too much
over to leeward, or foul of the clewline block under the yard, as it is
apt to, if the weather clew is hauled up first.
</p>

<p>
If the wind is very fresh, and the vessel close-hauled, a good practice
is to let go the lee sheet and halyards, and clew down, rounding in at
the same time on the weather brace. Then start the weather sheet, and
haul the weather clew chock up. Haul up the buntlines and steady the
yard by the braces.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To take in A Skysail.</span>&#8212;If bent in the way described in this
book, which is believed to be the most convenient, let go the halyards,
haul down on the brails, and haul taut the royal stay.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To take in a Jib.</span>&#8212;Let go the halyards, haul on the downhaul,
easing off the sheet as the halyards are let go.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To take in a Spanker.</span>&#8212;Ease off the outhaul, and haul well up
on the lee brails, taking in the slack of the weather ones. Mind
particularly the lee throat-brail. Haul the boom amidships and steady
it by the guys, lower the topping lifts, and square the gaff by the
vangs.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To furl a Royal.</span>&#8212;This sail is usually furled by one person,
and is that upon which green hands are practised. For the benefit of
beginners, I will give particular directions. When you have got aloft
to the topgallant mast-head, see, in the first place, that the yard is
well down by the lifts, and steadied by the braces; then see that both
clews are hauled chock up to the blocks, and if they are not, call out
to the officer of the deck, and have it done. Then see your yard-arm
gaskets clear. The best way is to cast them off from the tye, and lay
them across, between the tye and the mast. This done, stretch out on
the weather yard-arm, get hold of the weather leech, and bring it in to
the slings taut along the yard. Hold the clew up with one hand, and
with the other haul all the sail through the clew, letting it fall in
the bunt. Bring the weather clew a little over abaft the yard, and put
your knee upon it. Then stretch out to leeward and bring in the lee
leech in the same manner, hauling all the sail through the clew, and
putting the clew upon the yard in the same way, and holding it there by
your other knee. Then prepare to make up your bunt. First get hold of
the foot-rope and lay it on the yard and abaft; then take up the body
of the sail, and lay it on the yard, seeing that it is all fairly
through the clews. Having got all the sail upon the yard, make a
<i>skin</i> of the upper part of the body of the sail, large enough to
come well down abaft and cover the whole bunt when the sail is furled.
Lift the skin up, and put into the bunt the slack of the clews (not too
taut,) the leech and foot-rope, and the body of the sail; being careful
not to let it get forward under the yard or hang down abaft. Then haul
your bunt well upon the yard, smoothing the skin, and bringing it down
well abaft, and make fast the bunt-gasket round the mast, and the
jigger, if there be one, to the tye. The glut will always come in the
middle of the bunt, if it is properly made up. Now take your weather
yard-arm gasket and pass it round the yard, three or four times, haul
taut, and make it fast to the mast; then the lee one in the same
manner. Never make a long gasket fast to its own part round the yard,
for it may work loose and slip out to the yard-arm. Always pass a
gasket <i>over</i> the yard and down abaft, which will help to bring
the sail upon the yard.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">A Topgallant Sail</span> is furled in the same manner, except that it
usually requires two men, in a large vessel; in which case, each man
takes a yard-arm, and they make the bunt up together. If there are
buntlines and a jigger, the bunt may be triced well up, by bending the
jigger to the bight of a buntline, and having it hauled taut on deck.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To furl a Topsail or Course.</span>&#8212;The sail being hauled up, lay
out on the yard, the two most experienced men standing in the slings,
one on each side of the mast, to make the bunt up. The light hands lay
out to the yard-arms, and take the leech up and bring it taut along the
yard. In this way the clews are reached and handed to the men in the
bunt, and the slack of the sail hauled through them and stowed away on
and abaft the yard. The bunt being made up fairly on the yard against
the mast, and the skin prepared, let it fall a little forward, and stow
all the body of the sail, the clews, bolt-rope, and blocks, away in it;
then, as many as can get hold, lend a hand to haul it well upon the
yard. Overhaul a buntline a little, bend the jigger to it, and trice up
on deck. Bring the skin down well abaft, see that the clews are not too
taut, pass the bunt gasket, cast the jigger off, and make it fast slack
to the tye. Then pass the yard-arm gaskets, hauling the sail well upon
the yard, and passing the turns over the yard, and down abaft. If the
sail has long gaskets, make them fast to the tye; if short, pass them
in turns close together, and make them fast to their own parts, jammed
as well as possible.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To furl a Jib.</span>&#8212;Go out upon the weather side of the boom. See
your gasket clear for passing. The handiest way usually is, to make it
up on its end, take a hitch over the whole with the standing part, and
let it hang. Haul the sail well upon the boom, getting the clew, and
having the sheet pennant hauled amidships. Cast the hitch off the
gasket, take it in your hand, and pass two or three turns, beginning at
the head; haul them taut; and so on to the clew. Pass the turns over
and to windward. This will help to bring the sail upon the boom and to
windward. Make the end fast to the stay, to the withe, or to the boom
inside the cap, in any way that shall keep it from slipping back, which
it might do if made fast to its own part round the boom. If there is
but one hand on the boom, the first turns may be hauled taut enough to
keep the sail up for the time; then, after the gasket is fast, go out
to the head, and haul each turn well taut, beating the sail down with
the hand. Be careful to confine the clew well.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To stow a Jib in Cloth.</span>&#8212;Haul the jib down snugly, and get it
fairly up on the boom. Overhaul the after leech until you come to the
first straight cloth. Gather this cloth over the rest of the sail on
the boom, stopping the outer end of the cloth with a rope-yarn round
the jib stay. If the jib halyards are double, stop the block inside the
sail. Cover the sail well up with the cloth, stopping it at every two
feet with rope-yarns round the sail and boom. If you are to lie in port
for a long time, cast off the pennant, stow the clew on the boom,
snugly under the cloth, which will be stopped as before with
rope-yarns.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To reef a Topsail.</span>&#8212;Round in on the weather brace, ease off
the halyards, and clew the yard down by the clewlines and reef-tackles.
Brace the yard in nearly to the wind, and haul taut both braces. Haul
out the reef-tackles, make fast, and haul taut the buntlines. Before
going upon the yard, see that it is well down by the lifts. Let the
best men go to the yard-arms, and the light hands remain in the slings.
Cast adrift the weather earing, pass it <i>over</i> the yard-arm
outside the lift, down abaft and under the yard, and <i>up</i> through
the reef-cringle. Haul well out, and take a round-turn with the earing
round the cringle. Then pass several turns round the yard and through
the cringle, hauling them well taut, passing the turns <i>over</i> the
yard, down abaft and under, and <i>up</i> through the cringle.<a href="#note3" name="noteref3">
<small>[3]</small></a>
Having expended nearly all the earing, hitch the remainder round the
two first parts, that go outside the lift, jamming them together and
passing several turns round them both to expend the rope. The bare end
may be hitched to these two parts or to the lift. The men on the yard
light the sail out to windward by the reef-points, to help the man at
the weather yard-arm in hauling out his earing. As soon as the weather
earing is hauled out and made secure by a turn or two, the word is
passed&#8212;"Haul out to leeward," and the lee earing is hauled out till
the band is taut along the yard, and made fast in the same manner. Then
the men on the yard tie the reef-points with square knots, being
careful to take the after points clear of the topgallant sheets.
</p>

<p>
In reefing, a good deal depends upon the way in which the yard is laid.
If the yard is braced too much in, the sail catches flat aback and
cannot be hauled out, besides the danger of knocking the men off the
foot-ropes. The best way is to shiver the sail well till the yard is
down, then brace it in with a slight full, make the braces fast, and
luff up occasionally and shake the sail while the men are reefing. If
you are going before the wind, you may, by putting your helm either
way, and bringing the wind abeam, clew the yard down as the sail lifts,
and keep her in this position, with the yard braced sharp up, until the
sail is reefed; or, if you are not willing to keep off from your
course, and the wind is very fresh, clew down and clew up, and reef as
before directed.
</p>

<p>
All the reefs are taken in the same way except the <i>close reef</i>.
In close reefing, pass your earing <i>under</i> the yard, up abaft and
over, and <i>down</i> through the cringle. Pass all your turns in the
same manner; and bring the reef-band well under the yard in knotting,
so as to cover the other reefs.
</p>

<p>
As soon as the men are off the yard, let go the reef-tackles,
clewlines, buntlines, and topgallant sheets; man the halyards, let go
the lee brace, slack off the weather one, and hoist away. When well up,
trim the yard by the braces, and haul out the bowlines. A reefed sail
should never be braced quite sharp up, and if there is a heavy sea and
the vessel pitches badly, ease the braces a little, that the yard may
play freely, and do not haul the leech too taut.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To reef a Course.</span>&#8212;As a course generally has no reef-tackle,
you must clew it up as for furling, according to the directions before
given, except that the clews are not hauled chock up. Lay out on the
yard and haul out the earings, and knot the points as for the first
reef of a topsail, seeing them clear of the topsail sheets. If a long
course of bad weather is anticipated, as in doubling the southern
capes, or crossing the Atlantic in winter, reef-tackles are rove for
the courses.
</p>

<p>
If there are any studdingsail booms on the lower or topsail yards, they
must be triced up before reefing.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To turn out Reefs.</span>&#8212;For a topsail, haul taut the reef-tackles
and buntlines, settle a little on the halyards, if necessary; lay
aloft, and cast off all the reef-points, beginning at the bunt and
laying out. Be careful to cast all off before slacking up the earing;
for, when there is more than one reef, a point may be easily left, if
care is not taken. Have one hand at each earing, cast off all the turns
but enough to hold it, and when both earings are ready, ease off both
together. Pass the end of the earing through the cringle next above its
own, and make it fast slack to its own part by a bowline knot. Lay in
off the yard, let go reef-tackles, clewlines, buntlines, and topgallant
sheets; overhaul them in the top and hoist away, slacking the braces
and trimming the yard. The reefs of a course are turned out a good deal
in the same manner; slacking up the sheet and tack, if necessary, and,
when the earings are cast off, let go clew-garnets, buntlines and
leechlines, board the tack, and haul aft the sheet.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To set a Topgallant Studdingsail.</span>&#8212;This sail is always set
from the top; the sail, together with the tack and halyards in two
coils, being kept in the top. If there is but one hand aloft, take the
end of the halyards aloft, <i>abaft</i> everything, and reeve it
<i>up</i> through the block at the topgallant mast-head, and
<i>down</i> through the sheave-hole or block at the topgallant
yard-arm, <i>abaft</i> the sheet, and bring it into the top, forward of
the rigging, and make it fast to the forward shroud. Take the end of
your tack out on the topsail yard, <i>under</i> the brace, reeve it
<i>up</i> through the block at the end of the topgallant studdingsail
boom, bring it in <i>over</i> the brace, overhauling a plenty of it so
as to let the boom go out, and hitch it to the topmast rigging while
you rig your boom out. Cast off the heel-lashing and rig your boom out
to the mark, slue the boom with the block up and make fast round the
yard. (The easiest way of passing the boom-lashing is to take it over
the yard and put a bight up between the head-rope and yard; then take
the end back over the yard and boom and through the bight, and haul
taut. This may be done twice, if necessary, and then hitch it round all
parts, between the boom and the yard.) The boom being rigged out and
fast, take the end of your tack down into the top and hitch it to the
forward shroud. Then take the coil of the tack and throw the other end
down on deck, outside of the rigging and backstays. (It is well, in
throwing the coil down, to keep hold of the bight with one hand, for
otherwise, if they should miss it on deck, you will have to rig in your
boom.) Throw down the hauling end of your halyards abaft and inside
everything. Now get your sail clear for sending out. Lay the yard
across the top, forward of the rigging, with the outer end out. Bend
your halyards to the yard by a fisherman's bend, about one third of the
way out. Take your tack under the yard and bend it by a sheet-bend to
the outer clew, and pay down the sheet and downhaul through the
lubber-hole. All being clear for hoisting, sway away on the halyards on
deck, the men in the top guying the sail by the sheet and downhaul, the
latter being hauled taut enough to keep the outer clew up to the inner
yard-arm. (Sometimes it is well to make up the downhaul as is done with
the downhaul of the topmast studdingsail.) When the sail is above the
brace, haul out on the tack, sway the yard chock up by the halyards,
and trim the sheet down. Make the end of the downhaul fast slack.
</p>

<p>
A weather topgallant or topmast studdingsail should be set abaft the
sail, and a lee one forward of the sail. Therefore, in setting a lee
topgallant studdingsail, it is well to send it out of the top with a
turn in it, that is, with the inner yard-arm slued forward and out, so
that when the tack and sheet are hauled upon, the inner yard-arm will
swing forward of the topgallant sail.<a href="#note4" name="noteref4">
<small>[4]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
Small sized vessels have no downhaul to the topgallant studdingsails.
This saves confusion, and is very well if the sail is small.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To take in a Topgallant Studdingsail.</span>&#8212;Let go the tack and
clew up the downhaul, dipping the yard abaft the leech of the
topgallant sail, if it is forward. Lower away handsomely on the
halyards, hauling down on the sheet and downhaul. When the yard is
below the topsail brace, lower roundly and haul into the top, forward
of the rigging.
</p>

<p>
If the sail is taken in temporarily, stand the yard up and down and
becket it to the middle topmast shroud; make the sail up, hitch the
bight of the tack and halyards to the forward shroud, and haul up the
sheet and downhaul. If everything is to be stowed away, unreeve the
tack and halyards, and coil them away separately in the top; also coil
away the sheets and downhaul, and stop all the coils down by hitches
passed through the slats of the top. Rig the boom in and make it fast
to the tye. Sometimes the halyards are unrove from the yard-arm and
rounded up to the span-block, with a knot in their end.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To set a Topmast Studdingsail.</span>&#8212;The topmast studdingsail
halyards are generally kept coiled away in the top. Take the end up,
reeve it <i>up</i> through the span-block at the cap, and <i>out</i>
through the block at the topsail yard-arm, and pay the end down to the
forecastle, forward of the yard and outside the bowline. Pay the
hauling end down through the lubber-hole. Reeve your lower halyards.
These are usually kept coiled away in the top, with the pennant, which
hooks to the cap of the lower mast. Hook the pennant, reeve the
halyards <i>up</i> through the pennant block, <i>out</i> through the
block on the boom-end, and pay the end down to the forecastle. Pay the
hauling end down <i>forward</i> of the top. (Some vessels keep their
top-mast studdingsail tacks coiled away at the yard-arm, and hitched
down to the boom and yard. This is a clumsy practice, and saves no time
or trouble. The best way is to unreeve them whenever the boom is to be
rigged in, and coil them away in the bow of the long-boat, or
elsewhere. There is no more trouble, and less liability to confusion,
in reeving them afresh, than in coiling them away and clearing again on
the yard-arms.) Carry your tack outside the backstays and lower
rigging, clear of everything, out upon the lower yard under the brace;
reeve it <i>forward</i> through the tack-block at the boom-end, first
sluing the block up, and pay the end down forward of the yard. Rig the
boom out to the mark and lash it. Get the studdingsail on the
forecastle clear for setting. Bend the halyards to the yard, about one
half of the way out. Hitch the end of the downhaul over the inner
yard-arm by the eye in its end, reeve it through the lizard on the
outer leech, and through the block at the outer clew abaft the sail.
Bend the tack to the outer clew, and take a turn with the sheet. Clew
the yard down by the downhaul, and make the downhaul up just clear of
the block, by a catspaw doubled and the bight of the running part
shoved through the bight of all the parts, so that hauling on it may
clear it and let the yard go up. Hoist on the halyards until the sail
is above the lower yard, guying it by the sheet and downhaul, then haul
out on the tack until the clew is chock out to the boom-end, hoist on
the halyards, jerking the downhaul clear, and trim down the sheet.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To take in a Topmast Studdingsail.</span>&#8212;Lower away handsomely on
the halyards, clewing the yard down to the outer clew by the downhaul.
Slack up the tack, and lower away on the halyards, hauling down well on
the sheet and downhaul, till the sail is in upon the forecastle. The
sail may be made up on the forecastle, and the end of the tack and
halyards made fast forward, if it is to be soon set again. If not, cast
off all, unreeve your tack, hauling from aft, and coil it away. Unreeve
the halyards, or round them up to the block at the mast-head with a
knot in their end. Rig the boom in, and lash it to the slings.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To set a lower Studdingsail.</span>&#8212;Before rigging out the top-mast
studdingsail boom, the lower halyards should always be rove, as before
directed. Reeve the inner halyards <i>out</i> through a small single
block under the slings of the lower yard, and through another about two
thirds of the way out, and pay the end down upon the forecastle for
bending. Get the studdingsail clear, bend the outer halyards to the
yard, and the inner halyards to the inner cringle at the head of the
sail. Reeve the outhaul through the block at the swinging-boom-end, and
bend the forward end to the outer clew of the sail. Hook the
topping-lift and forward guy to the boom, and top up on it. Haul on the
forward guy, and ease off the after one, slacking away a little on the
topping-lift, until the boom is trimmed by the lower yard; then make
fast the guys and lift. Haul well taut the fore lift and brace, and
belay. Take a turn with one sheet, hoist away on the outer halyards,
and when about one third up, clear the downhaul, haul chock out on the
outhaul, and hoist well up by the halyards, which will serve as a lift
to the topmast studdingsail boom; and then set taut on the inner
halyards and trim down the sheet. The practice now is, and it is found
most convenient, to set the sail before rigging out the boom; then clap
on the outhaul and forward guy, and trim the boom by the lower yard.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To take in a lower Studdingsail.</span>&#8212;Let go the outhaul, and haul
on the clewline till the outer clew is up to the yard. Then lower away
the outer halyards, and haul in on the sheet and clewline. When the
sail is in over the rail, lower away the inner halyards. If the booms
are to be rigged in, cast off all the gear; making the bending end of
the outhaul fast in-board, and unreeving the outer and inner halyards,
or running the outer up to the pennant block, and the inner up to the
yard block, with knots in their ends. Ease off the forward guy with a
turn, haul in on the after guy, topping well up by the lift, and get
the boom alongside. Rig in the topmast studdingsail boom before
unreeving the outer halyards. It is a convenient practice, when the
swinging boom is alongside, to hook the topping-lift to a becket or
thimble at the turning in of the fore swifter, and the forward guy to a
strap and thimble on the spritsail yard.
</p>

<p>
In strong winds it is well to have a boom-brace-pennant fitted to the
topmast studdingsail boom-end with a single block, making a whip
purchase, the hauling part leading to the gangway, and belaying at the
same pin with the tack; or else, the brace may lead to the gangway, and
the tack be brought in through blocks on the yard, and lead down on
deck, beside the mast. The former mode is more usual.
</p>

<p>
The topmast studdingsail is sometimes made with a reef in it, to be
carried with a single reefed topsail; in which case it is reefed on
deck to the yard and sent out as before.

CHAPTER X.
</p>

<p class="head">
GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF WORKING A SHIP.
</p>

<p class="subhead">
Action of the water upon the rudder. Headway. Sternway. Action of the
wind upon the sails. Head-sails. After-sails. Centre of gravity or
rotation. Turning a ship to or from the wind.
</p>


<p>
A ship is acted upon principally by the rudder and sails. When the
rudder is fore-and-aft, that is, on a line with the keel, the water
runs by it, and it has no effect upon the ship's direction. When it is
changed from a right line to one side or the other, the water strikes
against it, and forces the stern in an opposite direction. For
instance, if the helm is put to the starboard, the rudder is put off
the line of the keel, to port. This sends the stern off to the
starboard, and, of course, the ship turning on her centre of gravity,
her head goes in an opposite direction, to port. If the helm is put to
port, the reverse will follow, and the ship's head will turn off her
course to starboard. Therefore the helm is always put in the opposite
direction from that in which the ship's head is to be moved.
</p>

<p>
Moving the rudder from a right line has the effect of deadening the
ship's way more or less, according as it is put at a greater or less
angle with the keel. A ship should therefore be so balanced by her
sails that a slight change of her helm may answer the purpose.
</p>

<p>
If a vessel is going astern, and the rudder is turned off from the line
of the keel, the water, striking against the back of the rudder, pushes
the stern off in the same direction in which the rudder is turned. For
instance, if sternway is on her, and the helm is put to the starboard,
the rudder turns to port, the water forces the stern in the same
direction, and the ship's head goes off to the starboard. Therefore,
when sternway is on a vessel, put the helm in the same direction in
which the head is to be turned.
</p>

<p>
A current or tide running astern, that is, when the ship's head is
toward it, will have the same effect on the rudder as if the ship were
going ahead; and when it runs forward, it will be the same as though
the ship were going astern.
</p>

<p>
It will now be well to show how the sails act upon a ship, with
reference to her centre of rotation. Suppose a vessel to be rigged with
three sails, one in the forward part, one at the centre, and the third
at the after part, and her left or larboard side to be presented to the
wind, which we will suppose to be abeam, or at right angles with the
keel. If the head sail only were set, the effect would be that the wind
would send the vessel a little ahead and off to the starboard on her
centre of rotation, so as to bring her stern slowly round to the wind.
If the after sail only were set, the vessel would shoot ahead a little,
her stern would go off to the starboard and her head come up into the
wind. If only the centre sail were set, the effect would be the same as
if all three of the sails were set, and she would go ahead in a
straight line. So far, we have supposed the sails to be set
<i>full</i>; that is, with their tacks forward and their sheets aft. If
they were all set <i>aback</i>, the vessel would go astern nearly, if
the rudder were kept steady, in a straight line. If the head sail only
is set and aback, she will go astern and round upon her axis, with her
head from the wind, much quicker than if full. So, if the after sail
alone were set and aback, she would go astern, and her head would come
suddenly into the wind.
</p>

<p>
These principles of the wind acting upon the sails, and the water upon
the rudder, are the foundation of the whole science of working a ship.
In large vessels the sails are numerous, but they may all be reduced to
three classes, viz., head sails, or those which are forward of the
centre of gravity or rotation, having a tendency to send the ship's
head off from the wind; after sails, or those abaft the centre of
rotation, and which send the stern off and the head toward the wind;
and lastly, centre sails, which act equally on each side the centre of
rotation, and do not turn the ship off her course one way or the other.
These classes of sails, if set aback, tend to stop the headway and send
the ship astern, and also to turn her off her course in the same
direction as when set full, but with more rapidity. The further a sail
is from the centre of rotation, the greater is its tendency to send the
ship off from the line of her keel. Accordingly, a jib is the strongest
head sail, and a spanker the strongest after sail.
</p>

<p>
The centre of rotation is not necessarily at the centre of the ship. On
the contrary, as vessels are now built, it may not be much abaft that
part of the deck to which the main tack is boarded. For the main
breadth, or dead-flat, being there, the greatest cavity will also be
there, and of course the principal weight of the cargo should centre
there, as being the strongest part. Therefore the centre of rotation
will greatly depend upon proper stowage. If the ship is much by the
stern, the centre of rotation will be carried aft, and if by the head,
it will be carried forward. The cause of this is, that when loaded down
by the stern, her after sails have but little effect to move her stern
against the water, and a very slight action upon the forward sails will
send her head off to leeward, as she is there light and high in the
air. Accordingly, to keep her in a straight line, the press of sail is
required to be further aft, or, in other words, the centre of rotation
is further aft. If a ship is loaded down by the head, the opposite
results follow, and more head and less after sail is necessary.
</p>

<p>
A ship should be so stowed, and have her sails so trimmed, that she may
be balanced as much as possible, and not be obliged to carry her helm
much off the line of her keel, which tends to deaden her way. If a ship
is stowed in her best sailing trim, and it is found, when on a wind,
that her head tends to windward, obliging her to carry a strong weather
helm, it may be remedied by taking in some after sail, or adding head
sail. So, if she carries a lee helm, that is, if her head tends to fly
off from the wind, it is remedied by taking in head or adding after
sail. Sometimes a ship is made to carry a weather helm by having too
much head sail set aloft. For, if she lies much over on a wind, the
square sails forward have a tendency to press her downwards and raise
her proportionally abaft, so that she meets great resistance from the
water to leeward under her bows, while her stern, being light, is
easily carried off; which, of course, requires her to carry a weather
helm.
</p>

<p>
The general rules, then, for turning a ship, are these: to bring her
head to the wind,&#8212;put the helm to leeward, and bring the wind to act
as much as possible on the after sails, and as little as possible on
the head sails. This may be done without taking in any sail, by letting
go the head sheets, so that those sails may lose their wind, and by
pointing the head yards to the wind, so as to keep the head sails
shaking. At the same time keep the after sails full, and flatten in the
spanker sheet; or, if this is not sufficient, the after sails may be
braced aback, which will send the stern off and the head to windward.
But as this makes back sails of them, and tends to send the vessel
astern, there should be either head or centre sails enough filled to
counteract this and keep headway upon her. On the other hand, to turn
the head off from the wind, put the helm to windward, shiver the after
sails, and flatten in the head sheets. Brace the head yards aback if
necessary, being careful not to let her lose headway if it can be
avoided.
</p>

<p>
The vessel may be assisted very much in going off or coming to, by
setting or taking in the jib and spanker; which, if the latter is
fitted with brails, are easily handled.

</p>


<p>
<span class="sc">Tacking.</span>&#8212;Have the ship so suited with sails that she may
steer herself as nearly as possible, and come to with a small helm.
Keep her a good full, so that she may have plenty of headway. <i>Ready,
About!</i> Send all hands to their stations. The chief mate and one,
two, or more of the best men, according to the size of the vessel, on
the forecastle, to work the head sheets and bowlines and the fore tack;
two or more good men (one usually a petty officer, or an older and
trusty seaman) to work the main tack and bowline. The second mate sees
the lee fore and main braces clear and ready for letting go, and stands
by to let go the lee main braces, which may all be belayed to one pin.
Put one hand to let go the weather cross-jack braces, and others to
haul in to leeward; the cook works the fore sheet, and the steward the
main; station one or more at the spanker sheet and guys; and the rest
at the weather main braces.
</p>

<p>
Ease the helm down gradually; <i>Helm's a-lee!</i> and let go the jib
sheet and fore sheets. As soon as the wind is parallel with the yards,
blowing directly upon the leeches of the square sails, so that all is
shaking, <i>Raise tacks and sheets!</i> and let go the fore and main
tacks and main sheet, keeping the fore and main bowline fast. As soon
as her head is within a point or a point and a half of the wind,
<i>Mainsail haul!</i> let go the lee main and weather cross-jack
braces, and swing the after yards round. While she is head to the wind,
and the after sails are becalmed by the head sails, get the main tack
down and sheet aft, and right your helm, using it afterwards as her
coming to or falling off requires. As soon as she passes the direction
of the wind, shift your jib sheets over the stays, and when the after
sails take full, or when she brings the wind four points on the other
bow, and you are sure of paying off sufficiently, <i>Let go and
haul!</i> brace round the head yards briskly, down fore tack and aft
the sheet, brace sharp up and haul your bowlines out, and trim down
your head sheets.
</p>

<p>
It is best to haul the mainsail just before you get the wind right
ahead, for then the wind, striking the weather leeches of the after
sails, forces them round almost without the braces, and you will have
time to brace up and get your tack down and sheet aft, when she has
payed off on the other side.
</p>

<p>
If she falls off too rapidly while swinging your head yards, so as to
bring the wind abeam or abaft, <i>'Vast bracing!</i> Ease off head
sheets and put your helm a-lee; and as she comes up, meet her and brace
sharp up. If, on the other hand, (as sometimes happens with vessels
which carry a strong weather helm,) she does not fall off after the
after sails take, be careful not to haul your head yards until she is
fully round; and if she should fly up into the wind, let go the main
sheet, and, if necessary, brail up the spanker and shiver the
cross-jack yards.
</p>

<p>
In staying, be careful to right your helm before she loses headway.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To tack without Fore-reaching</span>, as in a narrow channel, when
you are afraid to keep headway. If she comes slowly up to windward,
haul down the jib and get your spanker-boom well over to windward. As
you raise tacks and sheets, let go the lee fore topsail brace, being
careful to brace up again as soon as she takes aback. Also, hoist the
jib, and trim down, if necessary, as soon as she takes on the other
side.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Tacking against a heavy Head Sea.</span>&#8212;You are under short sail,
there is a heavy head sea, and you doubt whether she will stay against
it. Haul down the fore topmast staysail, ease down the helm, and raise
fore sheet. When within about a point of the wind's eye, let go main
tack and sheet, lee braces and after bowlines, and <i>Mainsail
haul!</i> If she loses her headway at this time, shift your helm. As
soon as she brings the wind on the other bow, she will fall off rapidly
by reason of her sternway, therefore shift your helm again to meet her,
and <i>Let go and haul!</i> at once. Brace about the head yards, but
keep the weather braces in, to moderate her falling off. When she gets
headway, right the helm, and as she comes up to the wind, brace up and
haul aft.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Tacking by hauling off all.</span>&#8212;This can be done only in a smooth
sea, with a light working breeze, a smart vessel and strong crew. Man
all the braces. Let her come up head to the wind, and fall off on the
other tack, shifting the helm if she gathers sternway. When you get the
wind about five points on the other bow, <i>Haul off all!</i> let go
all the braces and bowlines and swing all the yards at once. Right the
helm, board tacks and haul aft sheets, brace up and haul out.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To trim the Yards when close-hauled.</span>&#8212;In smooth water, with a
light breeze, brace the lower yards sharp up, and trim the upper yards
each a trifle in abaft the one below it. If you have a pretty stiff
breeze, brace the topsail yard in about half a point more than the
lower yard, and the topgallant yard half a point more than the topsail
yard, and so on. If you have a strong breeze and a topping sea, and
especially if reduced to short sail, brace in your lower yards a
little, and the others proportionally. This will prevent the vessel
going off bodily to leeward; and if she labors heavily, the play of the
mast would otherwise carry away the braces and sheets, or spring the
yards.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Missing Stays.</span>&#8212;If after getting head to the wind she comes to
a stand and begins to fall off before you have hauled your main yard,
flatten in your jib sheets, board fore tack, and haul aft fore sheet;
also ease off spanker sheet, or brail up the spanker, if necessary.
When she is full again, trim the jib and spanker sheets, and when she
has recovered sufficient headway, try it again. If, after coming head
to the wind, and after the after yards are swung, she loses headway and
refuses to go round, or begins to fall off on the same tack on which
she was before, and you have shifted the helm without effect, haul up
the mainsail and spanker, square the after yards, shift your helm again
a-lee, so as to assist her in falling off, and brace round the head
yards so as to box her off. As she fills on her former tack, brace up
the after yards, brace round the head yards, sharp up all, board tacks,
haul out and haul aft.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Wearing.</span>&#8212;Haul up the mainsail and spanker, put the helm up,
and, as she goes off, brace in the after yards. If there is a light
breeze, the rule is to keep the mizzen topsail lifting, and the main
topsail full. This will keep sufficient headway on her, and at the same
time enable her to fall off. But if you have a good breeze and she goes
off fast, keep both the main and mizzen topsails lifting. As she goes
round, bringing the wind on her quarter and aft, follow the wind with
your after yards, keeping the mizzen topsail lifting, and the main
either lifting or full, as is best. After a vessel has fallen off much,
the less headway she has the better, provided she has enough to give
her steerage. When you have the wind aft, raise fore tack and sheet,
square in the head yards, and haul down the jib. As she brings the wind
on the other quarter, brace sharp up the after yards, haul out the
spanker, and set the mainsail. As she comes to on the other tack, brace
up the head yards, keeping the sails full, board fore tack and aft the
sheet, hoist the jib, and meet her with the helm.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To wear under Courses.</span>&#8212;Square the cross-jack yards, ease off
main bowline and tack, and haul up the weather clew of the mainsail.
Ease off the main sheet, and haul up the lee clew, and the buntlines
and leechlines. Square the main yards and put the helm a-weather. As
she falls off, let go the fore bowline, ease off the fore sheet, and
brace in the fore yard. When she gets before the wind, board the fore
and main tacks on the other side, and haul aft the main sheet, but keep
the weather braces in. As she comes to on the other side, ease the
helm, trim down the fore sheet, brace up and haul out.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To wear under a Mainsail.</span>&#8212;Vessels lying-to under this sail
generally wear by hoisting the fore topmast staysail, or some other
head sail. If this cannot be done, brace the cross-jack yards to the
wind, and, if necessary, send down the mizzen topmast and the
cross-jack yard. Brace the head yards full. Take an opportunity when
she has headway, and will fall off, to put the helm up. Ease off the
main sheet, and, as she falls off, brace in the main yard a little.
When the wind is abaft the beam, raise the main tack. When she is dead
before it, get the other main tack down as far as possible; and when
she has the wind on the other quarter, ease the helm, haul aft the
sheet, and brace up.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To wear under bare Poles.</span>&#8212;Some vessels, which are well down
by the stern, will wear in this situation, by merely pointing the after
yards to the wind, or sending down the mizzen topmast and the
cross-jack yard, and filling the head yards; but vessels in good trim
will not do this. To assist the vessel, veer a good scope of hawser out
of the lee quarter, with a buoy, or something for a stop-water,
attached to the end. As the ship sags off to leeward, the buoy will be
to windward, and will tend to bring the stern round to the wind. When
she is before it, haul the hawser aboard.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Box-hauling.</span>&#8212;Put the helm down, light up the head sheets and
slack the lee braces, to deaden her way. As she comes to the wind,
raise tacks and sheets, and haul up the mainsail and spanker. As soon
as she comes head to the wind and loses her headway, square the after
yards, brace the head yards sharp aback, and flatten in the head
sheets. The helm, being put down to bring her up, will now pay her off,
as she has sternway on. As she goes off, keep the after sails lifting,
and square in the head yards. As soon as the sails on the foremast give
her headway, shift the helm. When she gets the wind on the other
quarter, haul down the jib, haul out the spanker, set the mainsail, and
brace the after yards sharp up. As she comes to on the other tack,
brace up the head yards, meet her with the helm, and set the jib.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Box-hauling short round</span>; sometimes called <i>wearing short
round.</i>&#8212;Haul up the mainsail and spanker, put the helm hard
a-weather, square the after yards, brace the head yards sharp aback,
and flatten in the head sheets. As she gathers sternway, shift the
helm. After this, proceed as in box-hauling by the former method. The
first mode is preferable when you wish to stop headway as soon as
possible; as a vessel under good way will range ahead some distance
after the sails are all thrown flat aback.
</p>

<p>
Few merchant vessels are strongly enough manned to perform these
evolutions; but they are often of service, as they turn a vessel round
quicker on her heel, and will stop her from fore-reaching when near in
shore or when close aboard another vessel.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Club-hauling.</span>&#8212;This method of going about is resorted to when
on a lee shore, and the vessel can neither be tacked nor box-hauled.
Cock-bill your lee anchor, get a hawser on it for a spring, and lead it
to the lee quarter; range your cable, and unshackle it abaft the
windlass. <i>Helm's a-lee!</i> and <i>Raise tacks and sheets!</i> as
for going in stays. The moment she loses headway, let go the anchor and
<i>Mainsail haul!</i> As soon as the anchor brings her head to the
wind, let the chain cable go, holding on to the spring; and when the
after sails take full, cast off or cut the spring, and <i>Let go and
haul!</i>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Drifting in a Tide-way.</span>&#8212;As a vessel is deeper aft than
forward, her stern will always tend to drift faster than her head. If
the current is setting out of a river or harbor, and the wind the
opposite way, or only partly across the current, you may work out by
tacking from shore to shore; or you may let her drift out, broadside to
the current; or, keeping her head to the current by sufficient sail,
you may let her drift out stern first; or, lastly, you may <i>club</i>
her down. If the wind is partly across the current, cast to windward.
If you work down by tacking, and the wind is at all across the current,
be careful of the lee shore, and stay in season, since, if you miss
stays, you may not be able to save yourself by wearing or box-hauling,
as you might on the weather shore. If the channel is very narrow, or
there are many vessels at anchor, the safest way is to bring her head
to the current, brace the yards full, and keep only sail enough to give
her steerage, that you may sheer from side to side. If there is room
enough, you will drift more rapidly by bringing her broadside to the
current, keeping the topsails shaking, and counteract the force of the
current upon the stern by having the spanker full and the helm a-lee.
You can at any time shoot her ahead, back her astern, or bring her head
to the current, by filling the head yards, taking in the spanker, and
setting the jib; filling the after yards, taking in the jib, and
setting the spanker; or by bracing all aback.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Backing and filling in a Tide-way.</span>&#8212;Counter-brace your yards
as in lying-to, and drift down broadside to the current. Fill away and
shoot ahead, or throw all aback and force her astern, as occasion may
require. When you approach the shore on either side, fill away till she
gets sufficient headway, and put her in stays or wear her round.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Clubbing in a Tide-way.</span>&#8212;Drift down with your anchor under
your foot, heaving in or paying out on your cable as you wish to
increase or deaden her way. Have a spring on your cable, so as to
present a broadside to the current. This method is a troublesome and
dangerous one, and rarely resorted to. An anchor will seldom drag
clear, through the whole operation.

</p>


<p>
<span class="sc">Lying-to.</span>&#8212;The best single sail to lie-to under, is generally
thought to be a close-reefed maintopsail. The fore or the main spencer
(sails which are used very much now instead of main and mizzen
staysails) may be used to advantage, according as a ship requires sail
more before or abaft the centre of gravity. If a ship will bear more
than one sail, it is thought best to separate the pressure. Then set
the fore and main spencers; or (if she carries staysails instead) the
main and mizzen staysail; or, if she is easier under lofty sail, the
fore and main topsails close-reefed. A close-reefed main topsail, with
three lower storm staysails; or, with the two spencers, fore topmast
staysail, and reefed spanker, is considered a good arrangement for
lying-to. If the fore topmast staysail and balance-reefed spanker can
be added to the two close-reefed topsails, she will keep some way, will
go less to leeward, and can be easily wore round. Close-reefed topsails
are used much more now for lying-to than the courses. As ships are now
built, with the centre of gravity farther forward, and the foremast
stepped more aft, they will lie-to under head sail better than
formerly. Some vessels, which are well down by the stern, will lie-to
under a reefed foresail, as this tends to press her down forward;
whereas, if she had much after sail, she would have all the lateral
resistance of the water aft, and would come up to the wind. In carrying
most head or after sail, you must be determined by the trim of the
vessel, her tendency to come to or go off, and as to whether the sail
you use will act as a lifting or a burying sail.
</p>

<p>
A topsail has an advantage over a spencer or lower staysail for
lying-to, since it steadies the ship better, and counteracts the heavy
weather roll, which a vessel will give under low and small fore-and-aft
sails.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Scudding.</span>&#8212;The most approved sail for scudding is the
close-reefed maintopsail, with a reefed foresail. The course alone
might get becalmed under the lee of a high sea, and the vessel, losing
her way, would be overtaken by the sea from aft; whereas the topsail
will always give her way enough and lift her. The foresail is of use in
case she should be brought by the lee. Many officers recommend that the
fore topmast staysail, or fore storm staysail, should always be set in
scudding, to pay her off if she should broach-to, and with the sheets
hauled flat aft.
</p>

<p>
It has been thought that with the wind quartering and a heavy sea, a
vessel is more under command with a close-reefed foretopsail and
maintopmast staysail. The foretopmast staysail may also be hoisted. If
the ship flies off and gets by the lee, the foretopsail is soon braced
about, and, with the maintopmast staysail sheet shifted to the other
side, the headway is not lost.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To heave-to after Scudding.</span>&#8212;Secure everything about decks,
and watch a smooth time. Suppose her to be scudding under a
close-reefed maintopsail and reefed foresail; haul up the foresail, put
the helm down, brace up the after yards, and set the mizzen staysail.
As she comes to, set the main staysail, meet her with the helm, brace
up the head-yards, and set the fore or foretopmast staysail.
</p>

<p>
If your vessel labors much, ease the lee braces and the halyards, that
everything may work fairly aloft, and let her have a plenty of helm, to
come to and fall off freely with the sea. The helmsman will often let
the wheel fly off to leeward, taking care to meet her easily and in
season. The sails should be so arranged as to require little of the
rudder.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Taken aback.</span>&#8212;It will frequently happen, when sailing
close-hauled, especially in light winds, from a shift of wind, from its
dying away, or from inattention, that the ship will come up into the
wind, shaking the square sails forward. In this case, it will often be
sufficient to put the helm hard up, flatten in the head sheets, or haul
their bights to windward, and haul up the spanker. If this will not
recover her, and she continues to come to, box her off. Raise fore tack
and sheet, haul up the spanker and mainsail, brace the head-yards
aback, haul the jib sheets to windward, and haul out the lee bowlines.
When the after sails fill, <i>Let go and haul!</i> This man&#339;uvre of
boxing can only be performed in good weather and light winds, as it
usually gives a vessel sternway.
</p>

<p>
If the wind has got round upon the other bow, and it is too late for
box-hauling, square the yards fore and aft, keeping your helm so as to
pay her off under sternway; and, as the sails fill, keep the after
yards shaking, and haul up the spanker and mainsail, squaring the
head-yards, and shifting your helm as she gathers headway.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Chappelling.</span>&#8212;This operation is performed when, instead of
coming to, you are taken aback in light winds. Put the helm up, if she
has headway, haul up the mainsail and spanker, and square the after
yards. Shift the helm as she gathers sternway, and when the after sails
fill, and she gathers headway, shift your helm again. When she brings
the wind aft, brace up the after yards, get the main tack down and
sheet aft, and haul out the spanker as soon as it will take. The head
braces are not touched, but the yards remain braced as before. The
former mode of wearing, by squaring the head-yards when the after sails
are full, has great advantages over chappelling, as the vessel will go
off faster when the wind is abeam and abaft, and will come to quicker
when the wind gets on the other side.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Broaching-to.</span>&#8212;This is when a vessel is scudding, and comes up
into the wind and gets aback. For such an accident, the foretopmast
staysail is set, which will act as an off-sail, so that by keeping the
helm up, with the maintopsail (if set) braced into the wind, she will
pay off again without getting sternway. If the close-reefed foretopsail
is carried instead of the main, it can be easily filled.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Brought by the Lee.</span>&#8212;This is when a vessel is scudding with
the wind quartering, and falls off so as to bring the wind on the other
side, laying the sails aback. This is more likely to occur than
broaching-to, especially in a heavy sea. Suppose the vessel to be
scudding under a close-reefed maintopsail and reefed foresail, with the
wind on her larboard quarter. She falls off suddenly and brings the
wind on the starboard quarter, laying all aback. Put your helm hard
a-starboard, raise fore tack and sheet, and fill the foresail,
shivering the maintopsail. When she brings the wind aft again, meet her
with the helm, and trim the yards for her course.

ACCIDENTS.
</p>

<p class="subhead">
On beam-ends. Losing a rudder. A squall. A man overboard. Collision.
Rules for vessels passing one another.
</p>


<p>
<span class="sc">On Beam-Ends.</span>&#8212;A vessel is usually thrown upon her beam-ends
by a sudden squall taking her, when under a press of sail, and shifting
the ballast. She must be righted, if possible, without cutting away the
masts. For, beside sacrificing them, the object can seldom be
accomplished in that way, if the ballast and cargo have shifted. Carry
a hawser from the lee quarter, with spars and other good stop-waters
bent to it. As the ship drifts well to leeward, the hawser will bring
her stern to the wind; but it may not cast her on the other side. If a
spring can be got upon the hawser from the lee bow, and hauled upon,
and the stern fast let go, this will bring the wind to act upon the
flat part of the deck and pay her stern off, and assist the spring,
when the sails may be trimmed to help her in righting. If she can be
brought head to the wind, and the sails be taken aback, she may cast on
the other tack. When there is anchoring ground, the practice is to let
go the lee anchor, which may take the sails aback and cast her. Then
the ballast and cargo may be righted.
</p>

<p>
If there is no anchoring ground, a vessel may still be kept head to the
wind, by paying a chain cable out of the lee hawse-hole; or by bending
a hawser to a large spar, which may be kept broadside-to by a span, to
the centre of which the hawser is bent. The same operation may be
applied to a vessel overset, and is preferable to wearing by a hawser.
Make fast the hawser forward to the lee bow, carry the other end aft to
windward and bend it to the spar, and launch the spar overboard. By
this means, or by letting go an anchor, though there be no bottom to be
reached, a vessel may often be recovered.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Losing a Rudder.</span>&#8212;The first thing to be done on losing a
rudder, is to bring the ship to the wind by bracing up the after yards.
Meet her with the head yards, as she comes to. Take in sail forward and
aft, and keep her hove-to by her sails. A vessel may be made to steer
herself for a long time, by carefully trimming the yards and slacking
up the jib sheets or the spanker sheet a little, as may be required.
</p>

<p>
Having got the ship by the wind, get up a hawser, middle it, and take a
slack clove-hitch at the centre. Get up a cable, reeve its end through
this hitch, and pay the cable out over the taffrail. Having payed out
about fifty fathoms, jam the hitch and rack it well, so that it cannot
slip; pay out on the cable until the hitch takes the water; then lash
the cable to the centre of the taffrail; lash a spare spar under it
across the stern, with a block well secured at each end, through which
reeve the ends of the hawser, one on each quarter, and reeve them again
through blocks at the sides, abreast of the wheel. By this, a ship may
be steered until a temporary rudder can be constructed.
</p>

<p>
A rudder may be fitted by taking a spare topmast, or other large spar,
and cutting it flat in the form of a stern-post. Bore holes at proper
distances in that part which is to be the fore part of the preventer or
additional stern-post; then take the thickest plank on board, and make
it as near as possible into the form of a rudder; bore holes at proper
distances in the fore part of it and in the after part of the preventer
stern-post, to correspond with each other, and reeve rope grommets
through those holes in the rudder and after part of the stern-post, for
the rudder to play upon. Through the preventer stern-post, reeve guys,
and at the fore part of them fix tackles, and then put the machine
overboard. When it is in a proper position, or in a line with the
ship's stern-post, lash the upper part of the preventer post to the
upper part of the ship's stern-post; then hook tackles at or near the
main chains, and bowse taut on the guys to confine it to the lower part
of the preventer stern-post. Having holes bored through the preventer
and proper stern-post, run an iron bolt through both, (taking care not
to touch the rudder,) which will prevent the false stern-post from
rising or falling. By the guys on the after part of the rudder and
tackles affixed to them, the ship may be steered, taking care to bowse
taut the tackles on the preventer stern-post, to keep it close to the
proper stern-post.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">A Squall.</span>&#8212;If you see a squall approaching, take in the light
sails, stand by to clew down, and keep her off a little, if necessary.
If you are taken by one, unprepared, with all sail set and
close-hauled, put the helm hard up, let go the spanker sheet and
outhaul, and the main sheet. Clew up royals and topgallant sails, haul
down flying-jib, haul up the mainsail, and clew down the mizzen
topsail. When you are before the wind, clew down the topsail yards, and
haul out the reef-tackles. You may run before the squall until it
moderates, or furl the light sails, bring by the wind, and reef.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">A Man overboard.</span><a href="#note5" name="noteref5">
<small>[5]</small></a>&#8212;The moment the cry is heard, put the helm
down and bring her up into the wind, whether she is on the wind or
free, and deaden her headway. Throw overboard instantly life buoys, or,
if there are none at hand, take a grating, the carpenter's bench, or
any pieces of plank or loose spars there may be about decks; and let
two or three hands clear away a quarter boat. The best plan is, if the
vessel was on the wind, to haul the mainsail up and brace aback the
after yards and raise the head sheets; then, having her main yard
aback, she will drift down directly toward the man. Keep your head
sails full to steady her, while the after ones stop her headway.
</p>

<p>
If you are sailing free, with studdingsails set, clew up the lower
studdingsail, brace up the head yards, haul forward the fore tack, and
keep the head yards full, while you luff up to back the after ones.
Lower away the boat as soon as it is safe, and, as the vessel will have
turned nearly round, direct the boat with reference to her position
when the accident happened and her progress since.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Collision.</span>&#8212;If two vessels approach one another, both having a
free wind, each keeps to the right. That is, the one with her starboard
tacks aboard keeps on or luffs; and the other, if it is necessary to
alter her course, keeps off. So, if two vessels approach one another
close-hauled on different tacks, and it is doubtful which is to
windward, the vessel on the starboard tack keeps on her course, and the
other gives way and keeps off. That is, each goes to the right, and the
vessel with her starboard tacks aboard has the preference. The only
exception to this is, that if the vessel on the larboard tack is so
much to windward that in case both persist the vessel on the starboard
tack will strike her to leeward and abaft the beam; then the vessel on
the starboard tack must give way, as she can do it more easily than the
other.
</p>

<p>
Another rule is that if one vessel is going dead before the wind and
the other going free on the starboard tack, the latter must luff and go
under the stern of the former.
</p>

<p class="chapter">
CHAPTER XIV.
</p>

<p class="head">
HEAVING-TO BY COUNTER-BRACING. SPEAKING. SOUNDING. HEAVING THE LOG.
</p>


<p>
<span class="sc">Counter-bracing.</span>&#8212;This is done whenever, with a breeze, a
vessel wishes to remain stationary, for the purpose of speaking another
vessel, sounding, lowering a boat, or the like. If you do not wish to
stop your way entirely, haul up the mainsail, square the main yards
aback, keeping the fore and cross-jack yards full, and the foresail,
spanker and jib set. If you wish to stop her way still more, back the
cross-jack yards also, haul up the foresail, and put the helm a-lee.
She will then fall off and come to, which you may regulate by the jib
and spanker sheets; and she may be ranged a little ahead, or deadened,
by filling or backing the cross-jack yards.
</p>

<p>
You may, on the other hand, back the head yards and fill the after
yards. The former method is called heaving-to with the maintopsail to
the mast, and the latter, with the foretopsail to the mast.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Speaking.</span>&#8212;When two vessels speak at sea, the one to windward
heaves her maintopsail to the mast, and the one to leeward her fore.
This is in order that the weather one may the more readily fill without
falling off so as to run afoul of the other, and that the lee one may
box her head off and keep clear of the ship to windward. The weather
one either throws all aback and drops astern, or fills her after yards
and shoots ahead. The lee one shivers her after yards and boxes off.
</p>

<p>
If the weather ship comes too near the lee one, before the latter has
time to wear, the weather ship squares her head yards, drops her
mainsail, braces her cross-jack yards sharp aback, and puts her helm
a-weather. This gives her sternway, and the after sails and helm keep
her to the wind.
</p>

<p>
If three vessels communicate at sea, the weather and middle ones back
their main topsails, and the lee one her fore; then, in case of
necessity, the weather one fills her after yards and shoots ahead, the
middle one throws all aback and drops astern, and the lee one shivers
her after sails and falls off.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Sounding.</span>&#8212;The marks upon the lead-lines have been given
previously, at page 17. To sound with the hand-lead, a man stands in
the weather main channels with a breast-rope secured to the rigging,
and throws the lead forward, while the vessel has headway on. If the
depth corresponds with the marks upon the line, as if it is 5, 7, or 10
fathoms, he calls out, "By the <i>mark five</i>!" &#38;c. If it is a depth
the fathoms of which have no mark upon the line, as 6, 8, or 9, he
calls out, "By the <i>deep six</i>!" &#38;c. If he judges the depth to be a
quarter or a half more than a particular fathom, as, for instance, 5,
he calls out, "And a quarter," or, "And a half, five!" &#38;c. If it is 5
and three quarters, he would say, "Quarter less six!" and so on.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To sound by the Deep-sea-lead.</span>&#8212;Have the line coiled down in a
tub or rack, clear for running, abreast of the main rigging. Carry the
end of the line forward on the weather side, outside of everything, to
the cat-head or the spritsail yard-arm, and bend it to the lead, which
must be armed with tallow. One man holds the lead for heaving, and the
others range themselves along the side, at intervals, each with a coil
of the line in his hand. An officer, generally the chief mate, should
stand by to get the depth. All being ready, the word is given,
"<i>Stand by! Heave!</i>" As soon as the man heaves the lead, he calls
out, "<i>Watch, ho! Watch!</i>" and each man, as the last fake of the
coil goes out of his hand, repeats, "<i>Watch, ho! Watch!</i>" The line
then runs out until it brings up by the lead's being on bottom, or
until there is enough out to show that there is no bottom to be
reached. The officer notes the depth by the line, which is then
snatched, and the men haul it aboard, and coil it away fair. If the
lead has been on the bottom, the arming of tallow will bring up some of
it; by which the character of the soundings may be ascertained.
</p>

<p>
The soundings, however, cannot be taken until the vessel's way has been
stopped or deadened. For this purpose, before heaving the lead, either
luff up and keep all shaking, or brace aback the main or mizzen
topsail, or both, according to your headway, keeping the head yards
full. If you are going free with studdingsails set, you may clew up the
lower and boom-end the topmast studdingsails, bring her up to the wind,
and keep the sails lifting, without getting them aback.
</p>

<p>
It has been laid down as a rule, that if the vessel sags much to
leeward, as when under short sail in a gale of wind, pass the line from
the weather side round the stern, clear of everything, and heave the
lead from the lee side; otherwise she would leave the lead too far to
windward for measurement, or for recovering it again. But in this mode
there is great danger of the line getting caught on the bottom or at
the rudder-heel. It must be very deep water if a vessel cannot be
managed so as to get soundings to windward.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Heaving the Log.</span>&#8212;One man holds the log-reel, upon which the
log-line is wound, another holds the glass, and the officer squares the
chip; and, having coiled up a little of the stray line, he throws the
chip overboard astern, or from the lee quarter. As he throws the chip,
he calls out, "Watch!" To which the man with the glass answers,
"Watch." As soon as the mark for the stray-line goes off the reel, he
calls out, "Turn!" and the man turns the glass, answering, "Turn," or
"Done." The instant the sand has run out, he calls, "Out!" or "Stop!"
and the officer stops the line and notes the marks. It is then wound up
again on the reel.

CHAPTER XV.

<p class="head">
COMING TO ANCHOR.
</p>

<p class="subhead">
Getting ready for port. Coming to anchor,&#8212;close-hauled&#8212;free. Mooring.
Flying moor. Clearing hawse. To anchor with a slip-rope. Slipping a
cable. Coming-to at a slipped cable.
</p>


<p>
<span class="sc">Getting ready for port.</span>&#8212;Get your anchors off the bows, and
let them hang by the cat-stoppers and shank-painters. Bend your cables
and overhaul a few ranges forward of the windlass, according to the
depth of the anchorage and the strength of the tide or wind, and range
the remainder that you expect to use along the decks, abaft the
windlass. Have the boats ready for lowering, and a spare hawser, with
some stout rope for kedging or warping, at hand, coiled on the hatches.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Coming to anchor.</span>&#8212;If you have the wind free and all sail set,
take in your studdingsails, make them up and stow them away, rig in the
booms and coil away the gear, and have all ready in good season. You
may then, as you draw in toward the anchorage, take in your royals and
flying jib, furling the royals if you have time. The topgallant sails
are next taken in, and the foresail hauled up. The topgallant sails may
be furled or not, according to the strength of the wind and the number
of hands. If you are before the wind, your mainsail will be hauled up,
or, if the sheet is aft, haul up the lee clew-garnet. Get your ship
under her topsails, jib and spanker. When near the ground, clew up the
fore and main topsails, put the helm down, haul down the jib and
flatten in the spanker. If you have too much headway, back the mizzen
topsail. Cock-bill your anchor and stream the buoy. When she has lost
her headway, let go the anchor. Let hands stand by to give her chain,
as she needs it.
</p>

<p>
If you come into anchoring ground close-hauled, haul in the weather
fore and main braces, and clew up. If the wind is light, you may square
the fore and main yards before clewing up. This will deaden her way. If
the wind is fresh, it would make it difficult to clew up the sails.
Haul down the jib, and come to by the spanker, or mizzen topsail and
spanker. If the wind is light, she may need the mizzen topsail; if not,
it may be taken in, and she may be brought to by the spanker. If she
has too much headway or there is a tide setting her in, throw all
aback.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mooring.</span>&#8212;A vessel is said to be moored when she rides with
more than one anchor, in different directions. The common method of
mooring is, when you have come to with one anchor, to pay out chain and
let her drop astern until you have out double the scope you intend to
ride by. Then let go your other anchor. Slack up the cable of the
latter anchor, and heave in on that of the first, until you have the
same scope to each anchor. You may also moor by lowering the anchor and
lashing it to the stern of the long boat, and coiling away the full
scope in the bottom of the boat. You may then pull off and pick out
your own berth, and let go.
</p>

<p>
If you wish to drop your second anchor in any other place than directly
to leeward of the first, you may, without using your long boat, warp
the vessel over the berth intended for your second anchor.
</p>

<p>
You should always moor so that you may ride with an open hawse in the
direction from which you are liable to the strongest winds. If you have
chain cables, you may moor with both cables bent to a swivel just clear
of the hawse hole, one chain coming in-board. In moderate weather, and
where you are not in a strong tide-way, it will generally be sufficient
to let go one anchor, since, if you have out a good scope of chain, you
will ride by the bight of it, and it will require a very heavy blow to
bring a strain upon the anchor.
</p>

<p>
In mooring, you should always have a shackle near the hawse-hole, for
clearing hawse. If it is just abaft the windlass, it will be convenient
in case you wish to slip your cable.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">A Flying Moor</span>&#8212;sometimes called a <span class="sc">RUNNING MOOR</span>.&#8212;Have
both anchors ready for letting go, with double the scope of chain you
intend to ride by ranged for the weather anchor, and the riding scope
of the lee chain. There are two ways of making a flying moor. One is to
clew up everything and let go the first anchor while she has sufficient
headway to run out the whole double range. When it is all out, or just
before, luff sharp up, brace aback to stop her way, and let go the
other anchor. Then heave in on the first and light out on the second,
until there is the same scope to each. This mode is almost
impracticable in a merchant vessel, where there is but one deck, and
where the chain may have to be paid out over a windlass, since the
headway would in most cases be soon stopped.
</p>

<p>
The other mode is, to lay all flat aback, and the moment the headway
ceases, let go your first anchor, paying out chain as she drops astern,
until double your riding scope is out. Then let go your second anchor
and heave in on the first.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Clearing Hawse.</span>&#8212;When a vessel is moored she may swing so as
to get a <i>foul hawse</i>; that is, so as to bring one cable across
the other. If one cable lies over the other, it is called <i>a
cross</i>. When they make another cross, it is called an <i>elbow</i>.
Three crosses make a <i>round turn</i>. The turns may be kept out of a
cable by tending the vessel when she swings, and casting her stern one
side or the other, by the helm, jib and spanker. To clear hawse, trice
the slack cable up by a line or a whip purchase and hook, below the
turns. Lash the two cables together just below the lowest turn. Pass a
line round the cable from outside, following each turn, and in through
the hawse-hole of the slack cable, and bend it to the shackle.
Unshackle and bend a line to the end. Rouse the cable out through the
hawse-hole, slacking up on the end line, and tricing up if necessary.
Take out the turns by the first line passed in, and haul in again on
the end line. Shackle the chain again, heave taut, and cast off the
lashings.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To anchor with a Slip-rope.</span>&#8212;This is necessary when you are
lying in an open road-stead, where you must stand out to sea upon a
gale coming up, without taking time to get your anchor. You must ride
at one anchor. Having come to, take a hawser round from the quarter on
the same side with your anchor, outside of everything, and bend its end
to the cable just below the hawse-hole. Have a buoy triced up forward,
clear of everything and carry the buoy-rope in through the hawse-hole,
and round the windlass, with three turns, (the first turn being
<i>outside</i> the others,) and bend it to the shackle which is to be
cast off when the cable is slipped. Have another buoy bent to the end
of the hawser which is to be used for the slip-rope.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To slip a Cable.</span>&#8212;When ready to slip, everything having been
prepared as above, unshackle the chain abaft the windlass, and hoist
the topsails, reefed, if necessary. Stream the buoy for the end of the
chain, and that at the end of the slip-rope aft. Take good turns with
the slip-rope round the timber-heads, at the quarter. Hoist the fore
topmast staysail and back the fore topsail, hauling in the braces on
the same side with the cable, so that she may cast to the opposite

the slip-rope aft, until her head is fairly off; then let go, brace

<p>
<span class="sc">Coming-to at a Slipped Cable.</span>&#8212;Keep a lookout for your buoys.
Having found them, heave-to to windward of them, send a boat with a
strong warp and bend it to the slip-rope buoy, take the other end to
the capstan and walk the ship up to the buoy. Take the slip-rope
through the chock, forward, and heave on it until you get the chain,
where the slip-rope was bent to it, under foot. Make well fast the
slip-rope, then fish the buoy at the end of the chain, haul up on that
buoy-rope, and get the end of the chain. Rouse it in through the
hawse-hole and shackle it. Heave taut, until the bend of the slip-rope
is above the water, then take the other end round aft and make it fast
at the quarter-port again. Pass in the buoy-rope for the end of the
chain, and you are all ready for slipping again.

<p class="head">
GETTING UNDER WAY.
</p>

<p class="subhead">
To unmoor. Getting under way from a single anchor. To cat and fish. To
get under way with a wind blowing directly out, and riding head to
it;&#8212;with a rock or shoal close astern;&#8212;when riding head to wind and
tide, and to stand out close-hauled;&#8212;wind-rode, with a weather
tide;&#8212;tide-rode, casting to windward;&#8212;tide-rode, wearing round.
</p>


<p>
<span class="sc">Unmoor.</span>&#8212;Pay out on your riding cable, heaving in the slack of
the other. When the other is short, trip it, cat and fish, and heave in
on your riding cable. Instead of this method, the anchor which you are
not riding by may be weighed, if it is a small one, by the long boat.
Send the long boat out over the anchor, take aboard the buoy-rope,
carrying it over the roller in the boat's stern, or through the end of
a davit, clap the watch-tackle to it, and weigh it out of the ground.
This done, and the buoy-rope and tackle secured to the boat, heave in
on the chain on board, which will bring the anchor alongside, the boat
approaching at the same time. When under the bow, cast off the fasts to
the boat, heave up the anchor, cat and fish.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Getting under way from a single Anchor.</span>&#8212;It is the duty of the
chief mate to see all ready forward for getting under way; the rigging
fair for making sail, the cat and fish-tackles rove, and the fish-davit
at hand. Heave short on your chain and pawl the windlass. Loose all the
sails, if the wind is light, and sheet home and hoist up topsails,
topgallant sails, and royals. If there is a stiff breeze, set topsails
alone, whole or reefed. You should always, if it will answer, cast on
the opposite side from your anchor; that is, if you are riding by your
starboard anchor, cast to port. Brace your head yards aback and your
after yards full, for the tack you mean to cast upon. The sails being
set, man the windlass again, give her a sheer with the helm, and trip
your anchor. The mate reports when it is away. As soon as it is away,
hoist the jib. The fore topsail aback will pay her head off. Put the
helm for stern-board. When her head is off enough, fill away the head
yards and haul out the spanker, shifting the helm for headway. Trim the
yards for your course, and make sail on her. If the wind is light and
the sea smooth, you may cat and fish your anchor after you get under
way; but it is best in a rough sea to keep the vessel hove-to until the
anchor is catted and fished.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To cat and fish an Anchor.</span>&#8212;When the anchor is lifted and
brought under foot, pawl the windlass, keeping a good hold on the
chain. Overhaul down the cat-block and hook it to the ring of the
anchor. Stretch along the cat-fall and let all hands tally on. Set taut
on the cat-tackle and pay out a little chain. Hoist away the anchor to
the cat-head, and belay the fall. Pass the cat-stopper through the ring
of the anchor, through the chock, belay it to the cat-tail, and seize
it to its own part. Overhaul down the fish-tackle, hook the lower block
to the pennant, and hook the fish-hook to the inner fluke of the
anchor. Rig out your fish-davit across the forecastle, and put the
bight of the pennant into the sheave-hole. Get a guy over it, near the
outer end, to keep it down, and another at the inner end, to keep it
out. Get the shoe over the side, to fend off the bill of the anchor.
Hoist the fluke well up, pass the shank-painter under the inner arm and
shank, bring it inboard, and belay and stop it to the timber-heads. Rig
in the davit, unreeve the cat-fall and fish-tackle.
</p>

<p>
A vessel may sometimes be got under way to advantage with the jib and
spanker; particularly if the wind is blowing directly out of the
harbor. Heave the anchor up at once. When it has broken ground, hoist
the jib, and, as she pays off, haul out the spanker. Keep her under
this sail until the anchor is catted and fished, then make sail and
stand out.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To get under way, with a wind blowing directly out, and riding head
to it.</span>&#8212;Suppose the ship to have her starboard anchor down. Heave
short and clear away the jib, and put the helm to port. Heave again
until the anchor is up to the bows. Cat and fish. When the anchor is
a-weigh, hoist the jib. Let her pay off under the jib. When she gathers
headway, shift the helm, and let fall the sails. When she gets before
it, sheet home and hoist the topsails, set the foresail, and haul down
the jib. Make sail aloft.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To get under way, riding head to the wind, with a rock or shoal
close astern.</span>&#8212;Suppose you wish to cast the ship on the starboard
tack. Heave in a safe scope on the chain, and run out a kedge with a
hawser from the starboard bow. Cast off the yard-arm gaskets and
mast-head the topsails, keeping the bunts fast. Heave taut on the
hawser, and brace the yards up for the starboard tack fore and aft,
hauling the jib sheet to windward. Heave up the anchor, taking in the
slack of the hawser, cat it, pass the stopper, and have all ready for
letting go. Haul ahead on the hawser, and as soon as the kedge is short
a-peak or comes home, sheet home the topsails, run up the jib, and put
the helm a-starboard. As soon as the jib fills, run the kedge up and
take it in. When the topsails take and she gathers headway, draw the
jib, set the spanker, board fore and main tacks, haul aft sheets, and
right the helm. If she falls off too rapidly when the topsails take,
give her the spanker and mainsail, easing off the jib sheet. When she
comes to, haul aft the jib sheet and board the fore tack. If, when the
kedge is a-weigh, she falls off on the wrong side, let go the anchor.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To get under way, riding head to wind and tide, and to stand out
close-hauled.</span>&#8212;Suppose you wish to cast to port. Heave short,
keeping the helm a-starboard. Set the topsails. Brace up the after
yards for the starboard tack, and back the head yards. Man the windlass
and heave up the anchor. When the anchor is a-weigh, hoist the jib.
When she has payed off sufficiently, fill away the head yards, shift
the helm for headway, set the spanker, and make sail. Cat and fish,
either before or after filling away.
</p>

<p>
If you have no room to cast on either side, but have a vessel on each
quarter, heave short, set the topsails, jib, and spanker, brace all the
yards half up for the starboard tack, weigh the anchor, and put the
helm to port. The tide acting on the rudder will sheer her head to
starboard. When the sails take aback and give her sternway, the rudder
and after sails will act against the head sails, and she will drift
fairly down between the two vessels. Keep her off or to, by the spanker
and jib. When you are clear, cast to port; or, haul up the spanker,
shiver the after yards, and let her go off before it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To get under way wind-rode, with a weather tide</span>; that is, a
tide setting to windward.&#8212;Suppose you wish to cast to port. Heave
short, loose the sails, and set the topsails. Square the after yards,
and haul in the starboard head-braces. Heave again, and, when you are
a-weigh, put the helm to port and hoist the jib. When she has payed off
enough, fill away the head yards and shift the helm for headway.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To get under way, tide-rode, casting to windward.</span>&#8212;Suppose the
wind to be a little on the starboard bow, and you wish to cast to
starboard, standing out on the larboard tack. Having hove short and set
the topsails, brace up the after yards for the larboard tack, and brace
the head yards aback. Weigh the anchor, keeping your helm to port, and
hauling the spanker boom well over to starboard. When she comes head to
the wind, hoist the jib, with the sheet to port. Shift the helm for
sternway. As she falls off, draw the jib, fill the head yards, and
shift the helm for headway.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">To get under way, tide-rode, wearing round.</span>&#8212;Suppose you have
the wind on your starboard quarter, and are obliged to wear her round
and stand out on the larboard tack. Set the topsails, square the head
yards, and shiver the after yards. When the anchor is a-weigh, put the
helm hard a-starboard, and give her the foresail, if necessary. Having
headway, she will go round on her keel, and you may proceed as in
wearing.
</p>

<p>
If a vessel is in a confined situation, without room to cast by her
sails or by the tide, she may be cast by a spring upon her cable,
leading in at that which will be the weather quarter. The spring may be
bent to the ring of the anchor before it is let go, or it may be seized
to the cable just outside the hawse-hole.
</p>

<p>
It will be remembered that when a vessel is riding head to the tide,
the helm is to be put as though she had headway; and when the tide sets
from astern, as though she had sternway. But you should be reminded
that when you have the wind and tide both ahead, if the vessel, after
you weigh your anchor, goes astern faster than the current, the helm
must be used as for stern-board.

CHAPTER I.
</p>

<p class="head">
THE MASTER.
</p>

<p class="subhead">
Beginning of the voyage. Shipping the crew. Outfit. Provisions.
Watches. Navigation. Log-book. Observations. Working ship. Day's work.
Discipline.
</p>


<p>
In the third part of this work, it will be seen that the shipmaster is
a person to whom, both by the general marine law of all commercial
nations and by the special statutes of the United States, great powers
are confided, and upon whom heavy responsibilities rest. The shipmaster
will find there what are his legal rights, duties and remedies as to
owner, ship and crew, and the various requirements as to the papers
with which he is to furnish his ship, and the observances of revenue
and other regulations.
</p>

<p>
It is proposed to give here, rather more, perhaps, for the information
of others than of the master himself, the ordinary and every-day duties
of his office, and the customs which long usage has made almost as
binding as laws.
</p>

<p>
There is a great difference in different ports, and among the various
owners, as to the part the master is to take in supplying and manning
the vessel. In many cases, the owner puts on board all the stores for
the ship's use and for the crew, and gives the master particular
directions, sometimes in writing, as to the manner in which he is to
dispense them. These directions are more or less liberal, according to
the character of the owner; and, in some cases, the dispensing of the
stores is left to the master's discretion. In other instances, the
master makes out an inventory of all the stores he thinks it expedient
to have put on board, and they are accordingly supplied by the owner's
order.
</p>

<p>
In the manner of shipping the crew, there is as great a difference as
in that of providing the stores. Usually, the whole thing is left to
shipping-masters, who are paid so much a head for each of the crew, and
are responsible for their appearance on board at the time of sailing.
When this plan is adopted, neither the master nor owner, except by
accident, knows anything of the crew before the vessel goes to sea. The
shipping-master opens the articles at his office, procures the men,
sees that they sign in due form, pays them their advance, takes care
that they, or others in their place, are on board at the time of
sailing, and sends in a bill for the whole to the owner. In other
cases, the master selects his crew, and occasionally the owner does it,
if he has been at sea himself and understands seamen; though a
shipping-master is still employed, to see them on board, and for other
purposes. In the ordinary course of short voyages, where crews are
shipped frequently, and there is not much motive for making a
selection, the procuring a crew may be left entirely to the agency of a
faithful shipping-master; but upon long voyages, the comfort and
success of which may depend much upon the character of a crew, the
master or owner should interest himself to select able-bodied and
respectable men, to explain to them the nature and length of the voyage
they are going upon, what clothing they will want, and the work that
will be required of them, and should see that they have proper and
sufficient accommodations and provisions for their comfort. The master
or owner should also, though this duty is often neglected, go to the
forecastle and see that it is cleaned out, whitewashed, or painted, put
in a proper habitable condition, and furnished with every reasonable
convenience. It would seem best that the master should have something
to do with the selection of the provisions for his men, as he will
usually be more interested in securing their good-will and comfort than
the owner would be.
</p>

<p>
By the master or owner's thus interesting himself for the crew, a great
deal of misunderstanding, complaint, and ill-will may be avoided, and
the beginning, at least, of the voyage be made under good auspices.
</p>

<p>
Unless the master is also supercargo, his duties, before sailing, are
mostly confined to looking after the outfit of the vessel, and seeing
that she is in sea order.
</p>

<p>
Everything being in readiness, the customhouse and other regulations
complied with, and the crew on board, the vessel is put under the
charge of the pilot to be carried out clear of the land. While the
pilot is on board, the master has little else to do than to see that
everything is in order, and that the commands of the pilot are
executed. As soon as the pilot leaves the ship, the entire control and
responsibility is thrown upon the master. When the vessel is well clear
of the land, and things are put into some order, it is usual for the
master to call all hands aft, and say something to them about the
voyage upon which they have entered. After this, the crew are divided
into watches. The watches are the divisions of the crew into two equal
portions. The periods of time occupied by each part of the crew, while
on duty, are also called watches.
</p>

<p>
There are two watches,&#8212;the larboard, commanded by the chief mate, and
the starboard, by the second mate. The master himself stands no watch,
but comes and goes at all times, as he chooses. The starboard is
sometimes called the captain's watch, probably from the fact that in
the early days of the service, when vessels were smaller, there was
usually but one mate, and the master stood his own watch; and now, in
vessels which have no second mate, the master keeps the starboard
watch. In dividing into watches, the master usually allows the officers
to choose the men, one by one, alternately; but sometimes makes the
division himself, upon consulting with his officers. The men are
divided as equally as possible, with reference to their qualities as
able seamen, ordinary seamen, or boys, (as all green hands are called,
whatever their age may be;) but if the number is unequal, the larboard
watch has the odd one, since the chief mate does not go aloft and do
other duty in his watch, as the second mate does in his. The cook
always musters with the larboard watch, and the steward with the
starboard. If there is a carpenter, and the larboard watch is the
largest, he generally goes aloft with the starboard watch; otherwise,
with the larboard.
</p>

<p>
As soon as the division is made, if the day's work is over, one watch
is set, and the other is sent below. Among the numerous customs of the
ocean, which can hardly be accounted for, it is one that on the first
night of the outward passage the starboard watch should take the first
four hours on deck, and on the first night of the homeward passage the
larboard should do the same. The sailors explain this by the old
phrase, that the master takes the ship out and the mate takes her home.
</p>

<p>
The master takes the bearing and distance of the last point of
departure upon the land, and from that point the ship's reckoning
begins, and is regularly kept in the log-book. The chief mate keeps the
log-book, but the master examines and corrects the reckoning every day.
The master also attends to the chronometer, and takes all the
observations, with the assistance of his officers, if necessary. Every
day, a few minutes before noon, if there is any prospect of being able
to get the sun, the master comes upon deck with his quadrant or
sextant, and the chief mate also usually takes his. The second mate
does not, except upon a Sunday, or when there is no work going forward.
As soon as the sun crosses the meridian, eight bells are struck, and a
new sea day begins. The reckoning is then corrected by the observation,
under the master's superintendence.
</p>

<p>
The master also takes the lunar observations, usually with the
assistance of both his officers; in which case, the master takes the
angle of the moon with the star or sun, the chief mate takes the
altitude of the sun or star, and the second mate the altitude of the
moon.
</p>

<p>
In regulating the hours of duty and sleep, the meal times, the food,
&#38;c., the master has absolute power; yet the customs are very nearly the
same in all vessels. The hour of breakfast is seven bells in the
morning, (half after seven,) dinner at noon, and supper whenever the
day's work is over. If the voyage is a long one, the crew are usually
put upon an allowance of bread, beef, and water. The dispensing of the
stores and regulating of the allowance lies, of course, with the
master, though the duty of opening the casks, weighing, measuring, &#38;c.,
falls upon the second mate. The chief mate enters in the log-book every
barrel or cask of provisions that is broached. The steward takes charge
of all the provisions for the use of the cabin, and keeps them in the
pantry, over which he has the direct control. The average of allowance,
in merchant vessels, is six pounds of bread a week, and three quarts of
water, and one pound and a half of beef, or one and a quarter of pork,
a day, to each man.
</p>

<p>
The entire control of the navigation and working of the ship lies with
the master. He gives the course and general directions to the officer
of the watch, who enters upon a slate, at the end of the watch, the
course made, and the number of knots, together with any other
observations. The officer of the watch is at liberty to trim the yards,
to make alterations in the upper sails, to take in and set royals,
topgallant sails, &#38;c.; but no important alteration can be made, as, for
instance, reefing a topsail, without the special order of the master,
who, in such cases, always comes upon deck and takes command in person.
When on deck, the weather side of the quarter-deck belongs to him, and
as soon as he appears, the officer of the watch will always leave it,
and go over to leeward, or forward into the waist. If the alteration to
be made is slight, the master usually tells the officer to take in or
set such a sail, and leaves to him the particular ordering as to the
braces, sheets, &#38;c., and the seeing all things put in place. The
principal man&#339;uvres of the vessel, as tacking, wearing, reefing
topsails, getting under way, and coming to anchor, require all hands.
In these cases, the master takes command and gives his orders in
person, standing upon the quarter-deck. The chief mate superintends the
forward part of the vessel, under the master, and the second mate
assists in the waist. The master never goes aloft, nor does any work
with his hands, unless for his own pleasure. If the officer of the
watch thinks it necessary to reef the topsails, he calls the master,
who, upon coming on deck, takes command, and, if he thinks proper,
orders all hands to be called. The crew, officers and all, then take
their stations, and await the orders of the master, who works the ship
in person, giving all the commands, even the most minute, and looks out
for trimming the yards and laying the ship for reefing. The chief mate
commands upon the forecastle, under the master, and does not go aloft.
The second mate goes aloft with the crew.
</p>

<p>
In tacking and wearing, the master gives all the orders, as to trimming
the yards, &#38;c., though the chief mate is expected to look out for the
head yards. So, in getting under way, and in coming to anchor, the
master takes the entire personal control of everything, the officers
acting under him in their several stations.
</p>

<p>
In the ordinary day's work, however, which is carried on in a vessel,
the state of things is somewhat different. This the master does not
superintend personally; but gives general instructions to the chief
mate, whose duty it is to see to their execution. To understand this
distinction, the reader will bear in mind that there are two great
divisions of duty and labor on shipboard. One, the <i>working and
navigating of the vessel</i>: that is, the keeping and ascertaining the
ship's position, and directing her course, the making and taking in
sail, trimming the sails to the wind, and the various nautical
man&#339;uvres and evolutions of a vessel. The other branch is, the work
done upon the hull and rigging, to keep it in order, such as the making
and fitting of new rigging, repairing of old, &#38;c.; all which, together
with making of small stuffs to be used on board, constitute the
<i>day's work and jobs</i> of the crew. As to the latter, the master
usually converses with the chief mate upon the state of the vessel and
rigging, and tells him, more or less particularly, what he wishes to
have done. It then becomes the duty of this officer to see the thing
accomplished. If, for instance, the master tells the chief mate to stay
the topmasts more forward, the chief mate goes upon the forecastle,
sets the men to work, one upon one thing and another upon another, sees
that the stays and backstays are come up with, has tackles got upon the
rigging, sights the mast, &#38;c. If the master sees anything which he
disapproves of, and has any preferences in the modes of doing the work,
he should call the officer aft and speak to him; and if, instead of
this, he were to go forward and give orders to the men, it would be
considered an interference, and indeed an insult to the officer. So
with any other work doing upon the ship or rigging, as rattling down,
turning in and setting up rigging, bending and unbending sails, and all
the knotting, splicing, serving, &#38;c., and the making of small stuffs,
which constitute the <i>day's work and jobs</i> of a vessel. If the
chief officer is a competent man, the master is not expected to trouble
himself with the details of any of these things; and, indeed, if he
were to do so to a great extent, it would probably lead to difficulty.
</p>

<p>
Where there are passengers, as in regular line of packet ships (or, as
they are familiarly called, <i>liners</i>,) between New York and
Liverpool or Havre, for instance, the master has even less to do with
the day's work; since the navigation and working of the ship, with
proper attention to his passengers, is as much as can reasonably be
required of him.
</p>

<p>
The master has the entire control of the cabin. The mates usually live
in a state room by themselves, or, if they live in the cabin, they yet
feel that the master is the head of the house, and are unwilling to
interfere with his hours and occupations. The chief mate dines with the
master, and the second mate looks out for the ship while they are
below, and dines at the second table. In the <i>liners</i>, however,
the mates usually dine together; the master looks out for the ship
while they are at dinner, and dines with his passengers at a later
hour.
</p>

<p>
As the master stands no watch, he comes and goes as he pleases, and
takes his own hours for rest. In fine weather, he is not necessarily
much on deck, but should be ready at all times, especially in bad
weather, to be up at a moment's notice.
</p>

<p>
Everything of importance that occurs, as the seeing a sail or land, or
the like, must be immediately reported to the master. And in heaving-to
for speaking, the master takes the entire charge of working the vessel,
and speaks the other sail in person.
</p>

<p>
As will be found in the third part of this book, the master has the
entire control of the discipline of the ship, and no subordinate
officer has authority to punish a seaman, or to use force, without the
master's order, except in cases of necessity not admitting of delay. He
has also the complete direction of the internal arrangements and
economy of the vessel, and upon his character, and upon the course of
conduct he pursues, depend in a great measure the character of the ship
and the conduct of both officers and men. He has a power and influence,
both direct and indirect, which may be the means of much good or much
evil. If he is profane, passionate, tyrannical, indecent, or
intemperate, more or less of the same qualities will spread themselves
or break out among officers and men, which, perhaps would have been
checked, if not in some degree removed, had the head of the ship been a
man of high personal character. He may make his ship almost anything he
chooses, and may render the lives and duties of his officers and men
pleasant and profitable to them, or may introduce disagreements,
discontent, tyranny, resistance, and, in fact, make the situation of
all on board as uncomfortable as that in which any human beings can
well be placed. Every master of a vessel who will lay this to heart,
and consider his great responsibility, may not only be a benefactor to
the numbers whom the course of many years will bring under his command,
but may render a service to the whole class, and do much to raise the
character of the calling.

The chief mate, or, as he is familiarly called on board ship, <i>the
mate</i>, is the active superintending officer. In the previous
chapter, upon the duties of the master, it will be seen that, in all
matters relating to the care of and work done upon the ship and
rigging, the master gives general orders to the mate, who attends
personally to their execution in detail. Indeed, in the <i>day's
work</i> on board ship, the chief mate is the only officer who appears
in command. The second mate works like a common seaman, and the men
seldom know what is to be done until they receive their orders in
detail from the chief mate. It is his duty to carry on the work, to
find every man something to do, and to see that it is done. He appoints
the second mate his work, as well as the common seamen theirs; and if
the master is dissatisfied with anything, or wishes a change, he should
speak to the chief mate, and let him make the change, and not interfere
with the men individually. It is also the duty of this officer to
examine all parts of the rigging, report anything of importance to the
master and take his orders, or, if it be a small and common matter, he
will have the repairs or changes made at his own pleasure, as a thing
of course. He must also see that there is a supply of small stuffs for
the work, and have them made up when necessary, and also that there are
instruments ready for every kind of labor, or for any emergency. In bad
weather, he must have spare rope, blocks, tackles, sennit, earings,
&#38;c., on hand; or rather, see that they are provided, the more immediate
care of these things, when provided, belonging to the second mate.
</p>

<p>
From this description of a chief mate's duty, it will be seen that he
ought always to be not only a vigilant and active man, but also well
acquainted with all kinds of seaman's work, and a good judge of
rigging.
</p>

<p>
In the working of the ship, when all hands are called and the master is
on deck, the chief mate's place is on the forecastle, where, under the
general direction of the master, who never need leave the quarter-deck,
he commands the forward part of the vessel, and is the organ of
communication with the men aloft. In getting under way and coming to
anchor, it is his duty to attend to the ground tackle, and see
everything ready forward. The master, for instance, tells him to have
the ship ready for getting under way, and to heave short on the cable.
He then goes forward, orders all hands to be called, sees everything
secured about decks, tackles got up and boats hoisted in and lashed,
fish and cat tackles, pennant, davit, &#38;c., and spare hawsers and rope,
in readiness, orders the men to the windlass, (the second mate taking a
handspike with the rest,) and stationing himself between the
knight-heads, looks out for the cable, ordering and encouraging the
men. When the cable is hove short, he informs the master, and, at the
word from him, orders the men aloft to loose the sails, and gives
particular directions to them when aloft, as to the sails, gaskets,
overhauling rigging, &#38;c. The sails being loosed, he awaits the order
from the master, which would be addressed to him rather than to the
men, and has the windlass manned and the anchor hove up, giving notice
to the master as soon as it is a-weigh. When the vessel is under way,
the master begins to take more immediate control, ordering the yards to
be braced and filled, sail to be set, and the like. The chief mate also
sees to the catting and fishing of the anchors, to having the decks
cleared up and everything secured.
</p>

<p>
In coming to anchor, very nearly the same duty falls upon the chief
officer. He must see the anchors and cables ready for letting go, the
master ordering how much chain is to be overhauled. He must look out
that the boats are ready for lowering, the rigging clear for letting
go, hauling and clewing, and that spare hawsers, kedges, warps, &#38;c.,
are at hand. If anything goes wrong forward, he alone is looked to for
an explanation. As the vessel draws in toward her anchoring ground, the
master gives all the orders as to trimming the yards and taking in
sail; and at all times, when on deck, has the entire charge of the man
at the helm, it being the mate's duty only to see that a good seaman is
there, and that the helm is relieved. As to the sails, the master will,
for instance, order&#8212;"Clew up the fore and main topsails!" The chief
mate then gives the particular orders as to lowering and letting go the
halyards, clewing down and up, overhauling rigging, &#38;c. If both
topsails were taken in at once, the second mate would attend to the
main, unless the master should choose to look out for it himself. All
being ready for letting go, the master gives the order&#8212;"Let go the
anchor!" and the chief mate sees that it is done, has the chain payed
out, reports how much is out, sees that the buoys <i>watch</i>, and the
like. In furling the sails, the whole superintendence comes upon the
mate, as the master would probably only tell him to have them furled.
He has the rigging hauled taut, sends the men aloft, and, remaining on
deck and forward, he gives his orders to them while on the yards, as to
the manner of furling, and has the ropes hauled taut or let go on deck,
as may be necessary.
</p>

<p>
These instances may serve to show the distinctions between the duties
of master and mate in the principal evolutions of a vessel. While in
port, the chief mate has much more the control of the vessel than when
at sea. As there is no navigating or working of the vessel to be done,
the master has little to engage him, except transactions with merchants
and others on shore, and the necessary general directions to the mate,
as to the care of the ship. Beside the work upon the ship and rigging
while in port, the chief mate has the charge of receiving, discharging,
stowing and breaking out the cargo. In this he has the entire control,
under the general directions of the master. It is his duty to keep an
account of all the cargo, as it goes in and comes out of the vessel,
and, as he generally gives receipts, he is bound to great care and
accuracy. When cargo is coming in and going out, the chief mate will
stand in the gangway, to keep an account, and the second mate will be
down in the hold with some of the crew, breaking out, or stowing. The
stowage, however, should still be somewhat under the chief mate's
directions. While the master is on shore, the chief mate is necessarily
commander of the ship, for the time, and though the law will extend his
power proportionably for cases of necessity, yet, except in instances
which will not admit of delay, he must not attempt to exercise any
unusual powers, but should refer everything to the master's decision.
It will be seen, by the laws, that the mate has no right to punish a
man during the master's absence, unless it be a case in which delay
would lead to serious consequences.
</p>

<p>
While in port, the chief mate stands no watch at night, but he should
always be the first to be called in the morning, and should be up early
and order the calling of all hands. In cleaning the ship, as washing
down decks, &#38;c., which is done the first thing in the morning, each
mate, while at sea, takes charge of it in his watch, in turn, as one or
the other has the morning watch; but in port, the second mate oversees
the washing down of the decks, under the chief mate's general orders.
</p>

<p>
While at sea, in tacking, wearing, reefing topsails, &#38;c., and in every
kind of "all hands work," when the master is on deck, the chief mate's
place, as I have said, is forward. To give a further notion of the
manner of dividing the command, I will describe the evolution of
tacking ship. The master finds that the ship will not lay her course,
and tells the chief mate to 'see all clear for stays,' or 'ready
about.' Upon this, the chief mate goes forward, sends all hands to
their stations, and sees everything clear and ready on the forecastle.
The master asks, "All ready forward?" and being answered, "Ay, ay,
sir!" motions the man at the helm to put the wheel down, and calls out,
"Helm's a-lee!" The mate, answering immediately, "Helm's a-lee," to let
the master know he is heard and understood, sees that the head sheets
are let go. At "Raise tacks and sheets!" from the master, the mate, and
the men with him, let go the fore tack, while he looks after the
overhauling of the other tack and sheet. He also sees to letting go the
bowlines for "Let go and haul," and to getting down the head sheets
when the ship is about, and trims the head yards, calling out to the
men at the braces the usual orders, "Well the fore yard!" "Topsail
yard, a small pull!" "Topgallant yard, well!" &#38;c. The master usually
trims the after yards.
</p>

<p>
In reefing topsails, the chief mate should not go aloft, but should
keep his place forward, and look out for the men on the yards. I am
aware that it has been the custom in some classes of vessels, as in the
New York liners, for the chief mate to take the weather earing of a
course, especially if a topsail or the other course were reefing at the
same time; yet this practice has never generally prevailed, and is now
going out of date. I think I may say it is the opinion of all, masters,
officers, and men, that it is better for the chief mate to remain on
deck. There is always a good deal to be looked after, ropes to be let
go or hauled, rigging to be cleared, and the like, beside the
importance of having some one to oversee the men on the different
yards; which the mate, standing at a little distance, can easily do. He
is also the organ of communication between the yards and the deck, and
can look after the reefing to more advantage than the master can upon
the quarter-deck, where he must stay to watch the helm and sails.
</p>

<p>
The chief mate is not required to work with his hands, like the second
mate and the seamen. He will, of course, let go and belay ropes, and
occasionally pull and haul with the men when working ship; but if there
is much work to be done, his time and attention are sufficiently taken
up with superintending and giving orders.
</p>

<p>
As to his duties as a watch-officer, it will be necessary to repeat the
explanations partly given in the chapter upon the master's duties. The
crew are divided equally into two watches, the larboard and starboard;
the larboard commanded by the chief mate, and the starboard by the
second mate. These watches divide the day between them, being on and
off duty every other four hours. This is the theory of the time, but in
fact, in nearly all merchant vessels, all hands are kept on deck and at
work throughout the afternoon, from one o'clock until sundown; and
sometimes, if there is a great deal to be done, as immediately before
making port, or after an accident, all hands may be kept throughout the
day. This is, however, justly considered hard usage, if long continued,
since it gives the men but little time for sleep, and none for reading,
or taking care of their clothes. Although all hands may be on deck and
at work during a day or a half day, yet the division of time is still
kept up. For instance, if it is the mate's watch from 8 A.M. to 12;
although all hands should be up from 12 to 5 or 6, yet from 12 to 4 the
starboard watch would be considered as 'the watch on deck,' and the
larboard again after 4; and so on; and during those hours the wheel
will always be taken by men belonging to the watch on deck, and if any
particular duty is ordered to be done by 'the watch,' that watch which
has a man at the helm, and which would have been the only one on deck
had not all hands been kept, would do the duty. But though this
division is kept up as to the crew and the helmsman, it is not so as to
the officers; for when all hands are on deck, the chief mate is always
the officer in command, to whichever watch the hour may properly
belong. He accordingly looks out for the ship, takes in and makes sail,
and trims the yards, when all hands are on deck at work, as much in the
hours of one watch as in those of the other, and he generally calls
upon the men of either watch indifferently to pull and haul. But if
only the starboard watch is on deck, though the chief mate should be on
deck also, yet he will not interfere with the duties of that watch, but
would leave the command of the vessel, and the weather side of the
quarter-deck, to the second mate. Of course, whenever the master comes
on deck, as I have said, in whosever watch it may be, or if all hands
are up, he takes the weather side of the quarter-deck, and is
considered as having charge of the ship; and the officer of the watch
would then give no order with reference to the helm, trimming the
yards, making sail, or the like, without a direction from the master.
</p>

<p>
It will be necessary to make some explanations as to the stations of
the chief and second mate. I have said that when all hands are called,
the chief mate's place is the forecastle, and the second mate's
amidships, or at the braces on the quarter-deck. This is only in
working ship with all hands; that is, in tacking, wearing, reefing,
coming to anchor, getting under way, &#38;c. Whenever the work is done, and
the necessity for the officers' presence at these parts of the vessel
ceases, they return to their proper places on the quarter-deck. In a
man-of-war there is always a lieutenant of the watch on the weather
side of the quarter-deck, whatever work may be going forward, except in
the single case of all hands being called to work ship; but it is not
so in the merchant service. When the ordinary day's work is going
forward, the mates must be about the decks or aloft, like the petty
officers of a man-of-war; and it is only while no work is going
forward, as in bad weather, on Sundays, or at night, that the officer
of the watch keeps the quarter-deck. At these times he does so, and, if
the master is not on deck, does not leave it, except for a short time,
and for some necessary duty forward.
</p>

<p>
It will be seen in the third part of this book, that the law looks upon
the chief mate as standing in a different relation to the master from
that of the second mate or the men. He is considered a confidential
person, to whom the owners, shippers and insurers look, in some
measure, for special duties and qualifications. The master, therefore,
cannot remove him from office, except under very peculiar
circumstances, and then must be able to prove a justifiable cause. One
of these duties which the law throws upon him, is keeping the log-book.
This is a very important trust, as the log-book is the depository of
the evidence of everything that may occur during the voyage; and the
position of the ship, the sail she was under, the wind, &#38;c., at any one
moment, may become matters of great consequence to all concerned. So it
is with reference to anything that may occur between the master or
officers and the crew. As to the manner of keeping the log, it is the
custom for each officer at the end of his watch to enter upon the
log-slate, which usually lies on the cabin table, the courses,
distances, wind and weather during his watch, and anything worthy of
note that may have occurred. Once in twenty-four hours the mate copies
from this slate into the log-book; the master, however, first seeing
the slate, examining it, and making any corrections or observations he
may choose. This practice of copying from the slate, which is first
submitted to the master, has led, in too many instances, to the mate's
becoming the mere clerk of the master, to enter on the log-book
whatever the latter may dictate. This is wrong. It is very proper that
the master should examine the slate, and suggest alterations as to the
ship's reckoning, &#38;c., if necessary, but it is important to all
concerned, both to the owners, shippers and insurers, on shore, and the
crew of the vessel, that the independence of the mate, as the
journalist of the voyage, should be preserved. The master, from the
power of his office, can at all times make the situation of a mate who
has displeased him extremely disagreeable, and from this cause has
great indirect influence over him; the law and the custom should
therefore be strictly adhered to which rightly make the chief officer,
in this respect, in a manner the umpire between the master and the
crew, as well as between all on board and the parties interested on
shore.
</p>

<p>
The law also makes the chief mate the successor to the master, in case
the latter should die, or be unable to perform the duties of his
office; and this without any action on the part of the crew. It is
always important, therefore, that, to the practical seamanship and
activity necessary for the discharge of the proper duties of his
office, the mate should add a sufficient knowledge of navigation to be
able to carry the ship on her voyage in case anything should happen to
the master. Indeed, it has been doubted whether a vessel of the largest
class, upon a long voyage, would be seaworthy with no navigator on
board but the master.
</p>

<p>
Both the chief and second mates are always addressed by their surnames,
with <i>Mr.</i> prefixed, and are answered with the addition of
<i>Sir</i>. This is a requirement of ship's duty, and an intentional
omission of it is an offence against the rules and understanding of the
service.

<p>
The duties of the second mate are, to command the starboard watch when
the master is not on deck, and to lead the crew in their work. It is
not necessary that he should be a navigator, or even be able to keep a
journal, though he should know enough of navigation to keep the courses
and distances during his watch, and to report them correctly on the
slate. There are also many advantages in his being acquainted with
navigation and able to keep the log, as, in case of the chief mate's
meeting with any accident, or being removed from office. The second
mate, however, does not, by law, necessarily succeed to the office of
chief mate, as the chief mate does to that of master; but it lies with
the master for the time being to appoint whom he chooses to the office
of chief mate: yet, if the second mate is capable of performing the
duties of the office, he would ordinarily be appointed, as a matter of
course.
</p>

<p>
When the starboard watch alone is on deck, and the master is below, the
second mate has charge of the ship. When both watches are on deck, the
chief mate is officer of the deck, to whichever watch the time may
belong, according to the division of the hours. When the master is on
deck, he commands, in one watch as well as in the other. But the second
mate does not give up the charge of the vessel to the chief mate, if he
should happen to be on deck during the starboard watch, unless all
hands are up. While he has charge of the vessel in his watch, his
duties are the common ones of a watch officer; that is, to have an eye
to the helm, watch the weather, keep a general lookout round the
horizon, see to the trimming of the yards and making and taking in of
the light sails, give the master notice of anything important that
occurs, heave the log and keep an account of the winds, courses, rate
of sailing, &#38;c., and enter the same on the slate at the end of the
watch. In these things the chief mate has no right to interfere, when
it is not his watch on deck. But in all matters connected with the
day's work and jobs, the second mate acts under the chief mate in his
own watch, as that department belongs peculiarly to the chief mate. In
working days, when the crew are employed about the ship and rigging, it
is usual for the chief mate to tell the second mate what to do in his
watch, and sometimes he remains on deck a few minutes to see to the
commencement of the work. And while day's work is going forward, during
the time that the chief mate has a watch below, as the second mate is
expected to do jobs like a common seaman, it is the custom for the
master to be on deck a good deal in the starboard watch and look after
the vessel. While work is going forward, the second mate is about decks
and aloft; but at other times, as at night, or on Sunday, or during bad
weather, when day's work cannot be kept up, his place is on the
quarter-deck; though still, he leaves it whenever anything is to be
done forward or aloft which requires the presence of a whole watch, as,
setting or taking in a lower or topmast studding-sail, or any of the
heavy sails.
</p>

<p>
When all hands are called to work ship, as in reefing, tacking,
wearing, getting under way, coming to anchor, &#38;c., the second mate's
place is aft, at the fore and main braces and main and mizzen rigging;
and generally, in all ship's duty, the chief mate and larboard watch
belong forward, and the second mate and starboard watch aft. In tacking
ship, the second mate looks out for the lee fore and main braces, sees
them belayed to one pin and clear for letting go, lets go the main
braces at "Mainsail haul!" and the fore at "Let go and haul!" He also
steadies the weather braces as the yards come up. He then sees to
getting down the main tack, hauling out the main and mizzen bowlines,
hauling aft the main sheet, and, in short, has charge of all the duty
to be done upon the quarterdeck and in the waist.
</p>

<p>
In getting under way, the second mate takes a handspike at the windlass
with the men, the place which custom has assigned him being the
windlass-end. If anything is to be done with the braces while the men
are heaving at the windlass, it is his duty to attend to it, as the
chief mate must be looking out for the ground tackle.
</p>

<p>
In reefing, the second mate goes aloft with the men, and takes his
place at the weather earing. This is his proper duty, and he will never
give it up, unless he is a youngster, and not strong enough or
sufficiently experienced to lead the men on the yard. As soon as the
order is given to clew down for reefing, and the halyards are let go,
if there are hands enough to haul out the reef-tackles, he should go
aloft, see that the yard is well down by the lifts, and then lay out to
the weather yard-arm, and get his earing rove by the time the men are
upon the yard. He then hauls it out and makes fast. If both topsails
are reefed at once, he goes to the main; but if one sail is reefed at a
time, he goes with the men from one to the other, taking the weather
earing of each. He also goes aloft to reef a course, and takes the
weather earing of that, in the same manner. He is not expected to go
upon the mizzen topsail yard, as the mizzen topsail is a small sail,
and can be reefed by a few men, or by the light hands.
</p>

<p>
In furling sails, the second mate goes aloft to the topsails and
courses, and takes the bunt, as that is the most important place in
that duty. He is not expected to go upon the mizzen topsail yard for
any service, and though in bad weather, and in case of necessity, he
would do so, yet it would be out of the usual course. He might also, in
heavy weather, assist in furling a large jib, or in taking the bonnet
off; but he never furls a topgallantsail, royal, or flying jib. In
short, the fore or main topsail and the courses are the only sails
which the second mate is expected to handle, either in reefing or
furling. And, as I said before, if the sails are reefed or furled by
the watch, he leads the starboard watch on the main and maintopsail
yards, and the best man in the larboard watch leads them at the fore.
</p>

<p>
Although the proper place for the second mate on a yard, is the bunt in
furling, and the weather earing in reefing, and it is the custom to
give him a chance at them at first, yet he cannot retain them by virtue
of his office; and if he has not the necessary strength or skill for
the stations, it is no breach of duty in a seaman to take them from
him; on the contrary, he must always expect, in such a case, to give
them up to a smarter man. If the second mate is a youngster, as is
sometimes the case, being put forward early for the sake of promotion,
or if he is not active and ambitious, he will not attempt to take the
bunt or weather earing.
</p>

<p>
In the ordinary day's work done on shipboard, the second mate works
with his hands like a common seaman. Indeed, he ought to be the best
workman on board, and to be able to take upon himself the nicest and
most difficult jobs, or to show the men how to do them. Among the
various pieces of work constantly going forward on the vessel and
rigging, there are some that require more skill and are less
disagreeable than others. The assignment of all the work belongs to the
chief mate, and if the second mate is a good seaman, (by which sailors
generally understand a good workman upon rigging,) he will have the
best and most important of these allotted to him; as, for instance,
fitting, turning in and setting up rigging, rattling down, and making
the neater straps, coverings, graftings, pointings, &#38;c.; but if he is
not a good workman, he will have to employ himself upon the inferior
jobs, such as are usually assigned to ordinary seamen and boys.
Whatever may be his capacity, however, he 'carries on the work,' when
his watch alone is on deck, under directions previously received from
the chief mate.
</p>

<p>
It is a common saying among seamen that a man does not get his hands
out of the tar bucket by becoming second mate. The meaning of this is,
that as a great deal of tar is used in working upon rigging, and it is
always put on by hand, the second mate is expected to put his hands to
it as the others do. If the chief mate were to take hold upon a piece
of work, and it should be necessary to put any tar on it, he might call
some one to tar it for him, as all labor by hand is voluntary with him;
but the second mate would be expected to do it for himself, as a part
of his work. These matters, small in themselves, serve to show the
different lights in which the duties of the officers are regarded by
all sea-faring men. There are, however, some inferior services, such as
slushing down masts, sweeping decks, &#38;c., which the second mate takes
no part in; and if he were ordered to do so, it would be considered as
punishment, and might lead to a difficulty.
</p>

<p>
In working ship, making and taking in sail, &#38;c., the second mate pulls
and hauls about decks with the rest of the men. Indeed, in all the work
he is expected to join in, he should be the first man to take hold,
both leading the men and working himself. In one thing, however, he
differs from the seamen; that is, he never takes the helm. Neither
master nor mates ever take the wheel, but it is left to the men, who
steer the vessel under the direction of the master or officer of the
deck. He is also not expected to go aloft to reeve and unreeve rigging,
or rig in and out booms, when making or taking in sail, if there are
men enough; but, as I have said, under ordinary circumstances, only
goes aloft to reef or furl a topsail or course. In case, however, of
any accident, as carrying away a mast or yard, or if any unusual work
is going on aloft, as the sending up or down of topmasts or topsail
yards, or getting rigging over the mast-head, sending down or bending a
heavy sail in a gale of wind, or the like, then the second mate should
be aloft to take charge of the work there, and to be the organ of
communication between the men aloft and the chief mate, who should
remain on deck, since he must superintend everything fore and aft, as
well as a-low and aloft. Sending up or down royal and topgallant yards,
being light work and done by one or two hands, does not call the second
mate aloft; but if the topgallant masts are to be sent down, or a
jib-boom rigged in bad weather, or any other work going on aloft of
unusual importance or difficulty, the second mate should be there with
the men, leading them in the work, and communicating with, and
receiving the orders from the deck.
</p>

<p>
During his own watch, if the master is not on deck, the second mate
commands the ship, gives his orders and sees to their execution,
precisely as the chief mate does in his; but, at the same time, he is
expected to lend a hand at every "all-hands rope."
</p>

<p>
There is another important part of the duties of a second mate; which
is, the care of the spare rigging, blocks, sails, and small stuffs, and
of the instruments for working upon rigging, as, marlinspikes, heavers,
serving-boards, &#38;c. It is the duty of the chief mate, as superintendent
of the work, to see that these are on board, and to provide a constant
supply of such as are made at sea; but when provided, it is the second
mate's duty to look after them, to see them properly stowed away, and
to have them at hand whenever they are called for. If, for instance,
the chief mate orders a man to do a piece of work with certain
instruments and certain kinds of stuff, the man will go to the second
mate for them, and he must supply him. If there is no sailmaker on
board, the second mate must also attend to the stowing away of the
spare sails, and whenever one is called for, it is his duty to go below
and find it. So with blocks, spare rigging, strands of yarns, and any
part of a vessel's furniture, which an accident or emergency, as well
as the ordinary course of duty, may bring into play.
</p>

<p>
So, also, with the stores. It is his duty to see to the stowing away of
the water, bread, beef, pork, and all the provisions of the vessel; and
whenever a new cask or barrel of water or provisions is to be opened,
the second mate must do it. Indeed, the crew should never be sent into
the hold or steerage, or to any part where there is cargo or stores,
without an officer. He also measures out the allowance to the men, at
the rate ordered by the master. These latter duties, of getting out the
stores and weighing or measuring the allowance, fall upon the third
mate, if there is one, which is seldom the case in merchant vessels.
</p>

<p>
While in port, when cargo is taking in or discharging, the second
mate's place is in the hold; the chief mate standing at the gangway, to
keep account, and to have a general supervision. If the vessel is lying
at anchor, so that the cargo has to be brought on or off in boats, then
the boating duty falls upon the second mate, who goes and comes in the
boats, and looks after the landing and taking off of the goods. The
chief mate seldom leaves the vessel when in port. The master is
necessarily on shore a good deal, and the second mate must come and go
in the boats, so that the chief mate is considered as the ship-keeper.
So, if a warp or kedge is to be carried out, or a boat is lowered at
sea, as in boarding another vessel, or when a man has fallen overboard,
in all such cases the second mate should take charge of the boat.
</p>

<p>
When in port, the second mate stands no anchor watch, but is expected
to be on deck until eight o'clock, which is the hour at which the watch
is usually set. If, however, the ship is short-handed, he would stand
his watch; in which case it would probably be either the first or the
morning watch.
</p>

<p>
The second mate lives aft, sleeping in the cabin, if there are no
passengers, or else in a state room in the steerage. He also eats in
the cabin, but at a second table, taking charge of the vessel while the
master and chief mate are at their meals. In packet ships the two mates
generally eat together, by themselves, at an earlier hour than the
master and passengers.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Third Mate.</span>&#8212;Merchant vessels bound on long voyages, upon
which there are many vicissitudes to be anticipated, sometimes carry a
third mate; but this is unusual; so much so, that his duties have
hardly become settled by custom. He does not command a watch, but
belongs to the larboard watch, and assists the chief mate in his
duties. He goes aloft with the larboard watch to reef and furl, as the
second mate does with the starboard, and performs very nearly the same
duties aloft and about decks. If he is a good seaman, he will take the
earing and bunt on the head yards, as the second mate does on the after
yards; and in the allotment of work he will be favored with the most
important jobs, if a good workman, otherwise, he will be put upon the
work of an ordinary seaman. He is not expected to handle the light
sails. He stands no helm, lives aft, and will look out for the vessel
at mealtimes, if the second mate dines with the master and chief mate.
While in port, he will be in the hold or in the boats, as he may be
needed, thus dividing the labor with the second mate. Perhaps his place
would more properly be in the boats, as that is considered more in the
light of fatigue duty. He also relieves the second mate of the charge
of the stores, and sees to the weighing and measuring of the
allowances; and in his watch on deck, he relieves the chief mate of the
inferior parts of his duty, such as washing decks in the morning, and
looking after the boys in clearing up the decks at night.

</p>


<p>
<span class="sc">Carpenter.</span>&#8212;Almost every merchant vessel of a large class, or
bound upon a long voyage, carries a carpenter. His duty is to work at
his trade under the direction of the master, and to assist in all-hands
work according to his ability. He is stationed with the larboard or
starboard watch, as he may be needed, though, if there is no third
mate, usually with the larboard. In working ship, if he is an able
seaman, (as well as carpenter,) he will be put in some more important
place, as looking after the main tack and bowlines, or working the
forecastle with the mate; and if capable of leading his watch aloft, he
would naturally take the bunt or an earing. He is not expected to
handle the light sails, nor to go above the topsail yards, except upon
the work of his trade. If he ships for an able seaman as well as
carpenter, he must be capable of doing seaman's work upon the rigging
and taking his turn at the wheel, if called upon; though he would not
be required to do it except in bad weather, or in case the vessel
should be short-handed. If he does not expressly ship for seaman as
well as carpenter, no nautical skill can be required of him; but he
must still, when all hands are called, or if ordered by the master,
pull and haul about decks, and go aloft in the work usual on such
occasions, as reefing and furling. But the inferior duties of the crew,
as sweeping decks, slushing, tarring, &#38;c., would not be put upon him,
nor would he be required to do any strictly seaman's work, except
taking a helm in case of necessity, or such work as all hands join in.
</p>

<p>
The carpenter is not an officer, has no command, and cannot give an
order even to the smallest boy; yet he is a privileged person. He lives
in the steerage, with the steward, has charge of the ship's chest of
tools, and in all things connected with his trade, is under the sole
direction of the master. The chief mate has no authority over him, in
his trade, unless it be in case of the master's absence or disability.
In all things pertaining to the working of the vessel, however, and as
far as he acts in the capacity of a seaman, he must obey the orders of
the officers as implicitly as any of the crew would; though, perhaps,
an order from the second mate would come somewhat in the form of a
request. Yet there is no doubt that he must obey the second mate in his
proper place, as much as he would the master in his. Although he lives
in the steerage, he gets his food from the galley, from the same mess
with the men in the forecastle, having no better or different fare in
any respect; and he has no right on the quarterdeck, but must take his
place on the forecastle with the common seamen.
</p>

<p>
In many vessels, during fine weather, upon long voyages, the carpenter
stands no watch, but "sleeps in" at night, is called at daylight, and
works all day at his trade. But in this case, whenever all hands are
called, he must come up with the rest. In bad weather, when he cannot
well work at his trade, or if the vessel becomes short-handed, he is
put in a watch, and does duty on deck, turning in and out with the
rest. In many vessels, especially those bound on short voyages, the
carpenter stands his watch, and, while on deck, works at his trade in
the day-time, if the weather will permit, and at night, or in bad
weather, does watch duty according to his ability.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Sailmaker.</span>&#8212;Some ships of the largest class carry a sailmaker,
though usually the older seamen are sufficiently skilled in the trade
to make and mend sails, and the master or chief mate should know how to
cut them out. As to the sailmaker's duty on board, the same remarks
will apply to him that were made upon the carpenter. If he ships for
seaman as well as sailmaker, he must do an able seaman's duty, if
called upon; and if he does not so ship, he will still be required to
assist in all-hands work, such as working ship, taking in and making
sail, &#38;c., according to his ability; and in bad weather, or a case of
necessity, he may be put with a watch and required to do ship's duty
with the rest. In all-hands work he is mustered with either watch,
according to circumstances, and the station allotted to him will depend
upon his qualities as a seaman; and, as with the carpenter, if he is a
good seaman, he would naturally have some more important post assigned
to him. He is not expected to handle the light sails, nor to go above
the topsail yards. Nor would the inferior duties of the crew, such as
tarring, slushing, and sweeping decks, be put upon him. In bad weather,
or in case of necessity, he may be mustered in a watch, and must do
duty as one of the crew, according to his ability. Sometimes he stands
no watch, and works at his trade all day, and at others he stands his
watch, and when on deck in the day time, and during good weather, works
at his trade, and at night, or in bad weather, does duty with the
watch. He usually lives in the steerage with the carpenter, and always
takes his food from the galley. He has no command, and when on deck,
belongs on the forecastle with the rest of the crew. In the work of his
trade, he is under the sole direction of the master, or of the chief
mate in the master's absence; but in ship's work he is as strictly
under the command of the mates, as a common seaman is.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Steward.</span>&#8212;The duties of the steward are very different in
packet ships, carrying a large number of passengers, from those which
are required of him in other vessels. In the New York <i>liners</i>,
for instance, he has waiters or under-stewards, who do most of the
labor, he himself having the general superintendence of the department.
It is his duty to see that the cabin and state-rooms are kept in order;
to see to the laying and clearing of the tables; to take care of the
dishes, and other furniture belonging to them; to provide the meals,
under the master's direction, preparing the nicer dishes himself; to
keep the general charge of the pantry and stores for the cabin; to look
after the cook in his department; and, lastly, which is as important a
part of his duty as any other, to attend to the comfort and convenience
of the passengers. These duties, where there are many passengers,
require all his time and attention, and he is not called upon for any
ship's duty.
</p>

<p>
In vessels which are not passenger-ships, he does the work which falls
to the under-stewards of the large packets: cleans the cabin and state
rooms, sets, tends and clears away the table, provides everything for
the cook, and has charge of the pantry, where all the table furniture
and the small stores are kept. He is also the body servant of the
master. His relation to the chief mate is somewhat doubtful; but the
general understanding is, that, although he waits upon him when at
table and must obey him in all matters relating to the ship's work, yet
he is not in any respect his servant. If the mate wishes any personal
service done, he would ask it, or make some compensation.
</p>

<p>
In these vessels, the steward must come on deck whenever all hands are
called, and in working ship, pulls and hauls about decks with the men.
The main sheet is called the steward's rope, and this he lets go and
hauls aft in tacking and wearing. In reefing and furling, he is
expected to go upon the lower and topsail yards, and especially the
mizzen topsail yard of a ship. No seamanship is expected of him, and he
stands no watch, sleeping in at night and turning out at daylight; yet
he must do ship's duty according to his ability when all hands are
called for working ship or for taking in or making sail. In these
things he must obey the mates in the same way that a common seaman
would, and is punishable for disobedience. The amount of ship's duty
required of him depends, as I have said, upon the number of passengers.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Cook.</span>&#8212;The cook almost always lives in the forecastle, though
sometimes in the steerage with the steward. He stands no watch,
sleeping in at night, and working at his business throughout the day.
He spends his time mostly in the cook-house, which is called the
'galley,' where he cooks both for the cabin and forecastle. This, with
keeping the galley, boilers, pans, kids, &#38;c., clean and in order,
occupies him during the day. He is called with all hands, and in
tacking and wearing, works the fore sheet. He is also expected to pull
and haul about decks in all-hands work, and is occasionally called from
his galley to give a pull at a tackle or halyards. No seamanship can be
required of him, but he is usually expected to go upon a lower or
topsail yard in reefing or furling, and to assist according to his
ability in working ship. In regular passenger-ships, however, as he is
more exclusively employed in cooking, he is not required to do any duty
about decks, except in a case of necessity or of common danger. In some
other vessels, too, if strongly manned, neither the cook nor steward
are sent upon the yards. Yet it can, without doubt, be required of
them, by the custom and understanding of the service, to go upon a
lower or topsail yard to reef or furl.
</p>

<p>
If there are on board armorers, coopers, or persons following any other
trades, they take the same place and follow the same rules as to duty
that govern the carpenter and sailmaker. In the merchant service, when
'all hands' are called, it literally calls every one on board but the
passengers; excepting, as I have said, in the case of the cook and
steward of strictly passenger-ships. Those persons of whom any duty can
be required, who do not stand a watch, but sleep in at night and work
during the day, are called <i>idlers</i>. Beside turning out with 'all
hands,' the idlers are sometimes called up at night to help the watch
on deck in any heavy or difficult duty, when it is not desirable to
call the other watch, who may have had severe service. This is
allowable, if practised only in cases of necessity, and not carried to
an extreme.

CHAPTER V.

ABLE SEAMEN.

<p class="subhead">
Grades of sea-faring persons. Able seamen. Ordinary seamen. Boys.
Shipping and rating. Over-rating. Requisites of an able seaman. Hand,
reef and steer. Work upon rigging. Sailmaking. Day's work. Working
ship. Reefing and furling. Watch duty. Coasters and small vessels.
</p>


<p>
Sea-faring persons before the mast are divided into three
classes,&#8212;able seamen, ordinary seamen, and boys or green hands. And it
may be remarked here that all green hands in the merchant service are
termed <i>boys</i>, and rated as such, whatever may be their age or
size. In the United States navy, an able seaman receives twelve dollars
per month, an ordinary seaman ten, and the boys, or green hands, from
four to eight, according to their strength and experience. In the
merchant service, wages are about the same on long voyages; but on
voyages to Europe, the West Indies, and the southern ports, they are
considerably higher, and very fluctuating. Still, the same proportion
between the classes is preserved, an ordinary seaman getting about two
dollars less than an able seaman, and the boys, from nothing up to two
dollars less than ordinary seamen, according to circumstances. A
full-grown man must ship for boy's wages upon his first voyage. It is
not unusual to see a man receiving boy's wages and rated as a boy, who
is older and larger than many of the able seamen.
</p>

<p>
The crews are not rated by the officers after they get to sea, but,
both in the merchant service and in the navy, each man rates himself
when he ships. The shipping articles, in the merchant service, are
prepared for so many of each class, and a man puts his name down and
contracts for the wages and duty of a seaman, ordinary seaman, or boy,
at his pleasure. Notwithstanding this license, there are very few
instances of its being abused; for every man knows that if he is found
incompetent to perform the duty he contracts for, his wages can not
only be reduced to the grade for which he is fitted, but that something
additional will be deducted for the deception practised upon all
concerned, and for the loss of service and the numerous difficulties
incurred, in case the fraud is not discovered until the vessel has got
to sea. But, still more than this, the rest of the crew consider it a
fraud upon themselves; as they are thus deprived of a man of the class
the vessel required, which makes her short-handed for the voyage, and
increases the duty put upon themselves. If, for instance, the articles
provide for six able seamen, the men expect as many, and if one of the
six turns out not to be a seaman, and is put upon inferior work, the
duties which would commonly be done by seamen will fall upon the five.
The difficulty is felt still more in the watches; as, in the case I
have supposed, there would be in one watch only two able seamen instead
of three, and if the delinquent was not a capable helmsman, the
increased duty at the wheel alone would be, of itself, a serious evil.
The officers also feel at liberty to punish a man who has so imposed
upon all hands, and accordingly every kind of inferior and disagreeable
duty is put upon him; and, as he finds no sympathy from the crew, his
situation on board is made very unpleasant. Indeed, there is nothing a
man can be guilty of, short of a felony, to which so little mercy is
shown on board ship; for it is a deliberate act of deception, and one
to which there is no temptation, except the gain of a few dollars.
</p>

<p>
The common saying that to hand, reef and steer makes a sailor, is a
mistake. It is true that no man is a sailor until he can do these
things; yet to ship for an able seaman he must, in addition to these,
be a good workman upon rigging. The rigging of a ship requires constant
mending, covering and working upon in a multitude of ways; and whenever
any of the ropes or yards are chafing or wearing upon it, it must be
protected by 'chafing gear.' This chafing gear consists of worming,
parcelling, serving, rounding, &#38;c.; which requires a constant supply of
small stuffs, such as foxes, sennit, spunyarn, marline, and the like,
all which is made on board from condemned rigging and old junk. There
is also a great deal of new rigging to be cut and fitted, on board,
which requires neat knots, splices, seizings, coverings, and turnings
in. It is also frequently necessary to set up the rigging in one part
of the vessel or another; in which case it must be seized or turned in
afresh. It is upon labor of this kind that the crew is employed in the
'day's work' and jobs which are constantly carried forward on board. A
man's skill in this work is the chief test of his seamanship; a
competent knowledge of steering, reefing, furling, and the like, being
taken for granted, and being no more than is expected of an ordinary
seaman. To put a marlinspike in a man's hand and set him to work upon a
piece of rigging, is considered a fair trial of his qualities as an
able seaman.
</p>

<p>
There is, of course, a great deal of difference in the skill and
neatness of the work of different men; but I believe I am safe in
saying that no man will pass for an able seaman in a square-rigged
vessel, who cannot make a long and short splice in a large rope, fit a
block-strap, pass seizings to lower rigging, and make the ordinary
knots, in a fair, workmanlike manner. This working upon rigging is the
last thing to which a lad training up to the sea is put, and always
supposes a competent acquaintance with all those kinds of work that are
required of an ordinary seaman or boy. A seaman is generally expected
to be able to sew upon a sail, and few men ship for seamen who cannot
do it; yet, if he is competent in other respects, no fault can be found
with an able seaman for want of skill in sailmaking.
</p>

<p>
In allotting the jobs among the crew, reference is always had to a
man's rate and capacity; and it is considered a decided imputation upon
a man to put him upon inferior work. The most difficult jobs, and those
requiring the neatest work, will be given to the older and more
experienced among the seamen; and of this none will complain; but to
single out an able seaman and keep him at turning the spunyarn winch,
knotting yarns or picking oakum, while there are boys on board, and
other properly seaman's work going forward at the same time, would be
looked upon as punishment, unless it were temporarily, or from
necessity, or while other seaman were employed in the same manner.
Also, in consideration of the superior grade of an able seaman, he is
not required to sweep down the decks at night, slush the masts, &#38;c., if
there are boys on board and at hand. Not that a seaman is not obliged
to do these things. There is no question but that he is, just as much
as to do any other ship's work; and if there are no boys on board or at
hand at the time, or from any other cause it is reasonably required of
him, no good seaman would object, and it would be a refusal of duty to
do so, yet if an officer were deliberately, and without necessity for
it, when there were boys about decks at the time, who could do the work
as well, to order an able seaman to leave his work and sweep down the
decks, or slush a mast, it would be considered as punishment.
</p>

<p>
In working ship, the able seamen are stationed variously; though, for
the most part, upon the forecastle, at the main tack or fore and main
lower and topsail braces; the light hands being placed at the
cross-jack and fore and main topgallant and royal braces. In taking in
and making sail, and in all things connected with the working of a
ship, there is no duty which may not be required of an able seaman; yet
there are certain things requiring more skill or strength, to which he
is always put, and others which are as invariably assigned to ordinary
seamen and boys. In reefing, the men go out to the yard-arms, and the
light hands stand in toward the slings; while in furling, the bunt and
quarters belong to the able seamen, and the yard-arms to the boys. The
light hands are expected to loose and furl the light sails, as royals,
flying jib and mizzen topgallant sail, and the men seldom go above the
cross-trees, except to work upon the rigging, or to send a mast or yard
up or down. The fore and main topgallant sails, and sometimes the
flying jib of large vessels, require one or more able seamen for
furling, but are loosed by light hands. In short, as to everything
connected with working ship, making and taking in sail, &#38;c., one
general rule may be laid down. A seaman is obliged to obey the order of
the master or officer, asking no questions and making no objection,
whether the duty to which he is ordered be that which properly belongs
to an able seaman or not; yet as able seamen alone can do the more nice
and difficult work, the light hands, in their turn, are expected to do
that which requires less skill and strength. In the watch on deck at
night, for instance, the able and ordinary seamen steer the ship, and
are depended upon in case of any accident, or if heavy sails are to be
taken in or set, or ropes to be knotted or spliced; and in
consideration of this, if there is light work to be done, as coiling up
rigging about decks, holding the log-reel, loosing or furling a light
sail, or the like, the boys are expected to do it, and should properly
be called upon by the officer, unless from some circumstance it should
be necessary to call upon a man. Yet, as I have said before, if
ordered, the seaman must do the thing, under any circumstances, and a
refusal would be a refusal of his duty.
</p>

<p>
No man is entitled to the rate or wages of an able seaman, who is not a
good helmsman. There is always a difference in a ship's company as to
this duty, some men being more steady, careful, and expert helmsmen
than others; and the best quality cannot be required of every able
seaman; yet if, upon fair trial, in bad weather, a man is found
incapable of steering the ship, under circumstances not extraordinary,
he would be considered by all on board to have failed of his duty. It
should be remembered, however, that there are times when the very best
helmsman is hardly able to steer a ship, and if a vessel is out of trim
or slow in her motions, no skill can keep her close to her course.
</p>

<p>
An able seaman is also expected to do all the work necessary for
reefing, furling, and setting sail, to be able to take a bunt or
earing, to send yards and masts up and down, to rig in and out booms,
to know how to reeve all the running rigging of a ship, and to steer,
or pull an oar in a boat.
</p>

<p>
The standard of seamanship, however, is not so high in coasting vessels
and those of a smaller class bound upon short voyages, in which all the
work that is necessary upon the vessel or rigging is usually done when
in port by people hired from on shore. In such vessels many men ship
for able seamen, and are considered, upon the whole, competent, if they
are able-bodied, and can hand, reef, and steer, who perhaps would only
have shipped for ordinary seamen in vessels bound upon long voyages. In
all large class vessels, and in vessels of almost any class bound upon
long voyages, the standard of seamanship is very nearly what I have
before described.

ORDINARY SEAMEN.
</p>

<p class="subhead">
Requisites. Hand, reef, and steer. Loose, furl, and set sails. Reeve

</p>


<p>
An ordinary seaman is one who, from not being of sufficient age and
strength, or from want of sufficient experience, is not quite competent
to perform all the duties of an able seaman, and accordingly receives a
little less than full wages, and does not contract for the complete
qualities of an able seaman. There is a large proportion of ordinary
seamen in the navy. This is probably because the power of the officers
is so great upon their long cruises to detect and punish any
deficiency, and because, if a man can by any means be made to appear
wanting in capacity for the duty he has shipped to perform, it will
justify a great deal of hard usage. Men, therefore, prefer rather to
underrate than to run any risk of overrating themselves.
</p>

<p>
An ordinary seaman is expected to hand, reef, and steer, under common
circumstances, (which includes 'boxing the compass;') to be well
acquainted with all the running and standing rigging of a ship; to be
able to reeve all the studdingsail gear, and set a topgallant or royal
studdingsail out of the top; to loose and furl a royal, and a small
topgallant sail or flying jib; and perhaps, also, to send down or cross
a royal yard. An ordinary seaman need not be a complete helmsman, and
if an able seaman should be put in his place at the wheel in very bad
weather, or when the ship steered with difficulty, it would be no
imputation upon him, provided he could steer his trick creditably under
ordinary circumstances. In reefing or furling the courses and topsails,
an ordinary seaman would not take the bunt or an earing, if there were
able seamen on the yard; and perhaps, in the largest sized vessels, it
would not be expected of him to pass an earing, or make up the bunt of
a fore or main topsail or course in bad weather, yet he should know how
to do both, and should be able to take a bunt or earing on the mizzen
topsail yard, and on any topsail or lower yard of a small vessel.
</p>

<p>
It is commonly understood that an ordinary seaman need not be a workman
upon rigging. Yet there are probably few men capable of performing the
duties of an ordinary seaman, as above detailed, who would not be
somewhat acquainted with work upon rigging, and who could not do the
simpler parts of it, such as, serving and splicing small ropes, passing
a common seizing, or the like; and it is always expected that an
ordinary seaman shall be able to make all the hitches, bends, and knots
in common use: such as, two half-hitches, a rolling hitch, timber
hitch, clove hitch, common bend, and bowline knot. He would also be
thought deficient if he could not draw, knot, and ball up yarns, and
make spunyarn, foxes, and common sennit. Yet it is said that if he can
steer his trick, and do his duty creditably in working ship and taking
in and making sail, he is entitled to the rate and wages of an ordinary
seaman, though he cannot handle a marlinspike or serving-board.
</p>

<p>
The duty upon which an ordinary seaman is put, depends a good deal upon
whether there are boys or green hands on board or not. If there are, he
has a preference over them, as an able seaman has over him, in the
light work; and since he stands his helm regularly and is occasionally
set to work upon rigging with the men, he will be favored accordingly
in the watch and in common duty about decks. Yet the distinction
between ordinary seamen and boys is not very carefully observed in the
merchant service, and an ordinary seaman is frequently called upon for
boy's duty, though there are boys on board and at hand. If an officer
wished for some one to loose a royal, take a broom and sweep the decks,
hold the log-reel, coil up a rope, or the like, he would probably first
call upon a boy, if at hand; if not, upon an ordinary seaman; but upon
either of them indifferently, before an able seaman.
</p>

<p>
If there are no boys on board, the ordinary seamen do boy's duty; the
only difference being, that if they take their trick at the wheel, and
do other ordinary seaman's work, the able seamen are not so much
preferred over them, as over mere boys and green hands.

<p>
Boy is the term, as I have said before, for all green hands, whatever
may be their size or age; and also for boys, who, though they have been
at sea before, are not large and strong enough for ordinary seamen. It
is the common saying, that a boy does not ship to know anything.
Accordingly, if any person ships as a boy, and upon boy's wages, no
fault can be found with him, though he should not know the name of a
rope in the ship, or even the stem from the stern. In the navy, the
boys are divided into three classes, according to their size and
experience, and different duties are put upon them. In the merchant
service, all except able and ordinary seamen are generally upon the
same wages, though boys' wages vary in different voyages. Sometimes
they get nothing, being considered as apprentices; and from that they
rise to three, five, and sometimes eight dollars per month. Whatever
boys' wages may be, a person who ships for them for that voyage,
whether more or less, is rated as boy, and his duty is according to his
rate.
</p>

<p>
In the ordinary day's work, the boys are taught to draw and knot yarns,
make spunyarn, foxes, sennit, &#38;c., and are employed in passing a ball
or otherwise assisting the able seamen in their jobs. Slushing masts,
sweeping and clearing up decks, holding the log-reel, coiling up
rigging, and loosing and furling the light sails, are duties that are
invariably put upon the boys or green hands. They stand their watches
like the rest, are called with all hands, go aloft to reef and furl,
and work whenever and wherever the men do, the only difference being in
the kind of work upon which they are put. In reefing, the boys lay in
toward the slings of the yard, and in furling, they go out to the
yard-arms. They are sent aloft immediately, as soon as they get to sea,
to accustom them to the motion of a vessel, and to moving about in the
rigging and on the yards. Loosing and furling the royals, setting
topgallant studdingsails and reeving the gear, shaking out reefs,
learning the names and uses of all the ropes, and to make the common
hitches, bends, and knots, reeving all the studdingsail gear, and
rigging in and out booms, and the like, is the knowledge first
instilled into beginners. There is a good deal of difference in the
manner in which boys are put forward in different vessels. Sometimes,
in large vessels, where there are plenty of men, the boys never take
the wheel at all, and are seldom put upon any but the most simple and
inferior duties. In others, they are allowed to take the wheel in light
winds, and gradually, if they are of sufficient age and strength,
become regular helmsmen. So, also, in their duties aloft; if they are
favored, they may be kept at the royals and topgallant sails, and
gradually come to the earing of a mizzen topsail. In work upon rigging,
however, a green hand makes but little progress beyond ropeyarns and
spunyarn, during his first voyage; since there are men enough to do the
jobs, and he can be employed to more advantage in the inferior work,
and in making and taking in light sails, steering in light winds, &#38;c.;
a competent knowledge of which duty is sufficient to enable him to ship
for an ordinary seaman upon the next voyage. It is generally while in
the grade of ordinary seaman that the use of the marlinspike is
learned. Whatever knowledge a boy may have acquired, or whatever may be
his age or strength, so long as he is rated as a boy, (and the rates
are not changed during a voyage unless a person changes his ship,) he
must do the inferior duties of a boy. If decks are to be cleared up or
swept, rigging to be coiled up, a man is to be helped in his job, or
any duty to be done aloft or about decks which does not require the
strength or skill of a seaman, a boy is always expected to start first
and do it, though not called upon by name.

<p>
<span class="sc">Watches.</span>&#8212;A watch is a term both for a division of the crew,
and for the period of time allotted to such division. The crew are
divided into two watches, larboard and starboard; the larboard
commanded by the chief mate, and the starboard by the second mate.
These watches divide the time between them, being on and off duty, or,
as it is termed, on deck and below, every other four hours. If, for
instance, the chief mate with the larboard watch have the first night
watch, from eight to twelve, at the end of the four hours the starboard
watch is called, and the second mate takes the deck, while the larboard
watch and the chief mate go below until four in the morning. At four
they come on deck again, and remain until eight; having what is called
the 'morning watch.' As they will have been on deck eight hours out of
the twelve, while the starboard watch, who had the middle watch, from
twelve to four, will only have been up four hours, they are entitled to
the watch below from eight till twelve, which is called the 'forenoon
watch below.' Where this alternation of watches is kept up throughout
the twenty-four hours, four hours up and four below it is called having
"watch and watch." This is always given in bad weather, and when day's
work cannot be carried on; but in most merchant vessels, it is the
custom to keep all hands from one P.M. until sundown, or until four
o'clock. In extreme cases, also, all hands are kept throughout the day;
but the watch which has had eight hours on deck at night should always
be allowed a forenoon watch below, if possible.
</p>

<p>
The watch from four to eight, P.M., is divided into two half-watches of
two hours each, called <i>dog-watches</i>. The object of this is to
make an uneven number of watches, seven instead of six; otherwise the
same watch would stand during the same hours for the whole voyage, and
those who had two watches on deck the first night would have the same
throughout the trip. But the uneven number shifts the watches. The
dog-watches coming about sundown, or twilight, and between the end of a
day's work and the setting of the night watch, are usually the time
given for recreation,&#8212;for smoking, telling yarns, &#38;c., on the
forecastle; things which are not allowed during the day.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Calling the Watch.</span>&#8212;As soon as eight bells are struck, the
officer of the watch gives orders to call the watch, and one of the
crew goes to the scuttle, knocks three times, and calls out in a loud
voice, "All the starboard (or larboard) watch, ahoy!" or, "All
starbowlines, ahoy!" or something of the kind, and adds, "Eight bells,"
or the hour; usually, also, a question, to know whether he is heard,
as, "Do you hear the news there, sleepers?" Some one of the watch below
must answer, "Ay, ay!" to show that the call has been heard. The watch
below is entitled to be called in a loud and audible voice, and in the
usual manner; and unless called, they cannot be expected to come up.
They must also turn out at once and come on deck as soon as they are
called, in order that the other watch may go below, especially as they
are never called until the hour has expired, and since some minutes are
allowed for turning out, dressing, and getting on deck. The man whose
turn it is to take the helm goes immediately aft, and ought to be the
first on deck, as the two hours' duty at the helm at night is tedious,
and entitles a man to be speedily relieved. It is considered a bad
trait in a man to be slack in relieving the helm. The relieving the
helm is also the sign that the watch is changed, and no man is
permitted to go below until that has been done. It is a man's watch on
deck so long as one of his watch is at the wheel.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Bells.</span>&#8212;The time at sea is marked by bells. At noon, eight
bells are struck, that is, eight strokes are made upon the bell; and
from that time it is struck every half-hour throughout the twenty-four,
beginning at one stroke and going as high as eight, adding one at each
half-hour. For instance, twelve o'clock is eight bells, half past
twelve is one bell, one o'clock is two bells, half past one three
bells, and so on until four o'clock, which will be eight bells. The
watch is then out, and for half past four you strike one bell again. A
watch of four hours therefore runs out the bells. It will be observed,
also, that even bells come at the full hours, and the odd bells at the
half-hours. For instance, eight bells is always twelve, four, or eight
o'clock; and seven bells always half past three, half past seven, or
half past eleven.
</p>

<p>
The bells are sounded by two strokes following one another quickly, and
then a short interval; after which, two more; and so on. If it is an
odd number, the odd one is struck alone, after the interval. This is to
make the counting more sure and easy; and, by this means, you can, at
least, tell whether it is an hour or a half-hour.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Helm.</span> Neither the master nor mates of a merchant vessel ever
take the helm. The proper helmsmen are the able and ordinary seamen.
Sometimes the carpenter, sailmaker, &#38;c., if they are seamen, are put at
the helm; also the boys, in light winds, for practice. Each watch
steers the ship in its turn, and the watch on deck must supply the
helmsman, even when all hands are called. Each man stands at the helm
two hours, which is called his <i>trick</i>. Thus, there are two tricks
in a watch. Sometimes, in very cold weather, the tricks are reduced to
one hour; and, if the ship steers badly, in a gale of wind, two men are
sent to the wheel at once. In this case, the man who stands on the
weather side of the wheel is the responsible helmsman, the man at the
lee wheel merely assisting him by heaving the wheel when necessary.
</p>

<p>
The men in the watch usually arrange their tricks among themselves, the
officers being satisfied if there is always a man ready to take the
wheel at the proper time. In steering, the helmsman stands on the
weather side of a wheel and on the lee side of a tiller. But when
steering by tiller-ropes with no hitch round the tiller-head, or with a
tackle, as in a heavy gale and bad sea, when it is necessary to ease
the helm a good deal, it is better to stand up to windward and steer by
the parts of the tackle or tiller-ropes.
</p>

<p>
In relieving the wheel, the man should come aft on the lee side of the
quarter-deck, (as indeed he always should unless his duty lies to
windward,) go to the wheel behind the helmsman and take hold of the
spokes, so as to have the wheel in command when the other lets go.
Before letting go, the helmsman should give the course to the man that
relieves him in an audible voice, and the new man should repeat it
aloud just as it was given, so as to make it sure that he has heard
correctly. This is especially necessary, since the points and half
points are so much alike that a mistake might easily be made. It is the
duty of the officer of the watch to be present when the wheel is
relieved, in order to see that the course is correctly reported and
understood; which is another reason why the course should be spoken by
both in a loud tone. It is unseamanlike and reprehensible to answer,
"Ay, ay!" or, "I understand," or the like, instead of repeating the
course.
</p>

<p>
If a vessel is sailing close-hauled and does not lay her course, the
order is, "Full and by!" which means, by the wind, yet all full. If a
vessel lays her course, the order then is her course, as N.W. by W., E.
by S., and the like.
</p>

<p>
When a man is at the wheel, he has nothing else to attend to but
steering the ship, and no conversation should be allowed with him. If
he wishes to be relieved during his trick, it should not be done
without the permission of the officer, and the same form of giving and
repeating the course should be gone through, though he is to be absent
from the helm but a minute or two.
</p>

<p>
If an order is given to the man at the wheel as to his steering, he
should always repeat the order, distinctly, that the officer may be
sure he is understood. For instance, if the order is a new course, or,
"Keep her off a point!" "Luff a little!" "Ease her!" "Meet her!" or the
like, the man should answer by repeating the course or the order, as,
"Luff a little, sir," "Meet her, sir," &#38;c., and should not answer, "Ay,
ay, sir!" or simply execute the order as he understands it. This
practice of repeating every, even the most minute order at the wheel,
is well understood among seamen, and a failure or refusal to do so is
an offence sometimes leading to disagreeable results.
</p>

<p>
If, when the watch is out and the other watch has been called, all
hands are detained for any purpose, as, to reef a topsail, to set
studdingsails, or the like, the helm should not be relieved until the
work is done and the watch ready to go below.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Answering.</span>&#8212;The rule has just been stated which requires a man
at the wheel to answer by repeating distinctly the order given him. The
same rule applies to some other parts of a seaman's duty, though to
none so strictly, perhaps, as to that. In tacking, where the moment of
letting go a rope or swinging a yard is very important, the order of
the master is always repeated by the officer on the forecastle. This
enables the master to know whether he is heard and understood, to
repeat his order if it is not answered at once, and to correct any
mistake, or obviate some of its consequences. The same may be said
generally of every order to the proper or instant execution of which
unusual importance is attached. If, for instance, a man is stationed by
a rope to let it go upon an order given, if an order is addressed to
him which he supposes to be for that purpose, he should answer, "Let
go, sir!" and usually adds, "All gone!" as soon as it is done. Green
hands should bear in mind that whenever an order is of a kind which
ought to be repeated, it must be so, without reference to a man's
distance from the officer who gives the order, but just as much if
standing a few feet from him as if at the mast-head, since, upon the
whole, the chance of misapprehension is not much less in one case than
in the other.
</p>

<p>
The common run of orders, however, are sufficiently answered by the
usual reply of "Ay, ay, sir!" which is the proper seaman's answer,
where the repetition of the order is not necessary. But <i>some answer
or other should always be made to an order</i>. This is a rule
difficult to impress upon beginners, but the reasonableness of it is
obvious, and it is well understood among all seafaring persons; and
even though an officer should see that the man was executing his order,
he still would require, and has a right to demand a reply. The rule is
as strictly observed by the master and officers between themselves, as
it is required by them of the men; for the reason is the same. It is
almost unnecessary to say that the addition 'Sir' is always to be used
in speaking to the master or to either of the mates. The mates in their
turn use it to the master. 'Mr.' is always to be prefixed to the name
of an officer, whether chief or second mate.
</p>

<p>
In well-disciplined vessels, no conversation is allowed among the men
when they are employed at their work; that is to say, it is not allowed
in the presence of an officer or of the master; and although, when two
or more men are together aloft, or by themselves on deck, a little low
conversation might not be noticed, yet if it seemed to take off their
attention, or to attract the attention of others, it would be
considered a misdemeanor. In this respect the practice is different in
different vessels. Coasters, fishermen, or small vessels on short
voyages, do not preserve the same rule; but no seaman who has been
accustomed to first class ships will object to a strictness as to
conversations and laughing, while at day's work, very nearly as great
as is observed in a school. While the crew are below in the forecastle,
great license is given them; and the severest officer will never
interfere with the noise and sport of the forecastle, unless it is a
serious inconvenience to those who are on deck. In working ship, when
the men are at their stations, the same silence and decorum is
observed. But during the dog-watches, and when the men are together on
the forecastle at night, and no work is going forward, smoking,
singing, telling yarns, &#38;c., are allowed; and, in fact, a considerable
degree of noise and <i>skylarking</i> is permitted, unless it amounts
to positive disorder and disturbance.
</p>

<p>
It is a good rule to enforce, that whenever a man aloft wishes anything
to be done on deck, he shall hail the officer of the deck, and not call
out, as is often done, to any one whom he may see about decks, or
generally to have a thing done by whoever may happen to hear him. By
enforcing this rule the officer knows what is requested, and may order
it and see that it is done as he thinks fit; whereas, otherwise, any
one about decks, perhaps a green hand, may execute the order upon his
own judgment and after his own manner.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Stations.</span>&#8212;The proper place for the seamen when they are on
deck and there is no work going forward, is on the forecastle. By this
is understood so much of the upper deck as is forward of the after
fore-shroud. The men do not leave this to go aft or aloft unless ship's
duty requires it of them. In working ship, they are stationed
variously, and go wherever there is work to be done. The same is the
case in working upon rigging. But if a man goes aft to take the wheel,
or for any other purpose which does not require him to go to windward,
he will go on the lee side of the quarter-deck.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Food, Sleep, &#38;c.</span>&#8212;The crew eat together in the forecastle, or
on deck, if they choose, in fine weather. Their food is cooked at the
galley, and they are expected to go to the galley for it and take it
below or upon the forecastle. The cook puts the eatables into wooden
tubs called "kids," and of these there are more or less, according to
the number of men. The tea or coffee is served out to each man in his
tin pot, which he brings to the galley. There is no table, and no
knives nor forks to the forecastle; but each man helps himself, and
furnishes his own eating utensils. These are usually a tin pot and pan,
with an iron spoon.
</p>

<p>
The usual time for breakfast is seven bells, that is, half past seven
o'clock in the morning. Consequently, the watch below is called at
seven bells, that they may get breakfast and be ready to take the deck
at eight o'clock. Sometimes all hands get breakfast together at seven
bells; but in bad weather, or if watch and watch is given, it is usual
for the watch below to breakfast at seven bells, and the watch on deck
at eight bells, after they are relieved. The dinner hour is twelve
o'clock, if all hands get dinner together. If dinner is got 'by the
watch,' the watch below is called for dinner at seven bells (half past
eleven,) and the other watch dine when they go below, at twelve.
</p>

<p>
If all hands are kept in the afternoon, or if both watches get supper
together, the usual hour is three bells, or half past five; but if
supper is got by the watch, three bells is the time for one watch and
four for the other.
</p>

<p>
In bad weather, each watch takes its meals during the watch below, as,
otherwise, the men would be liable to be called up from their meals at
any moment.
</p>

<p>
As to the time allowed for <span class="sc">SLEEP</span>; it may be said, generally,
that a sailor's watch below is at his own disposal to do what he
chooses in, except, of course, when all hands are called. The meal
times, and time for washing, mending, reading, writing, &#38;c., must all
come out of the watch below; since, whether there is work going forward
or not, a man is considered as belonging to the ship in his watch on
deck. At night, however, especially if watch and watch is not given, it
is the custom in most merchant vessels, in good weather, to allow the
watch to take naps about the decks, provided one of them keeps a
look-out, and the rest are so that they can be called instantly. This
privilege is rather a thing winked at than expressly allowed, and if
the man who has the look-out falls asleep, or if the rest are slow in
mustering at a call, they are all obliged to keep awake. In bad
weather, also, or if near land, or in the track of other vessels, this
privilege should not be granted. The men in each watch usually arrange
the helms and look-outs among themselves, so that a man need not have a
helm and a look-out during the same watch. A man should never go below
during his watch on deck, without permission; and if he merely steps
down into the forecastle for an instant, as, to get his jacket, he
should tell some one, who may speak to him at once, if the watch is
called upon.

<span class="sc">Title.</span>&#8212;The bill of sale is the proper evidence of title to

which is in most cases absolutely required.<a href="#note6" name="noteref6">
<small>[6]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
Possession of the vessel should also accompany the bill of sale,
whenever it is practicable. If the bill of sale is transferred while
the vessel is at sea, possession should be taken immediately upon her
arrival in port. The fact of the bill of sale being with one person and
the actual possession of the vessel with another, after there has been
an opportunity to transfer it, will raise a presumption of fraud, and
make the parties liable to losses and difficulties in dealing with
creditors, and such as purchase in good faith.<a href="#note7" name="noteref7">

<p>
<span class="sc">Registry, Enrolment, and License.</span>&#8212;The laws of the United
States have given many privileges to vessels built, owned and commanded
by our own citizens. Such vessels are entitled to be registered,
enrolled or licensed, according to circumstances, and are thereupon
considered "vessels of the United States, entitled to the benefits and
privileges appertaining to such ships." The only vessels entitled to a
register are those built in the United States and owned wholly by
citizens thereof; vessels captured in war by our citizens, and
condemned as prizes; and vessels adjudged to be forfeited for breach of
the laws of the United States, being wholly owned by such citizens. No
owner is compelled to register his vessel, but unless registered (with
the exception of those enrolled and licensed in the coasting and
fishing trades) she is not entitled to the privileges and benefits of a
"vessel of the United States," although she be built, owned and
commanded by citizens thereof.<a href="#note8" name="noteref8">

thereof forfeit fifty dollars.<a href="#note11" name="noteref11">

tons' burden, in order to be entitled to the privileges of vessels of
the United States in those trades, must be enrolled and licensed; and
if less than twenty tons, must be licensed.<a href="#note16" name="noteref16">
<small>[16]</small></a> The same qualifications
and requisites in all respects are demanded in order to the enrolling
and licensing of a vessel, which are required for registering.<a href="#note17" name="noteref17">
<small>[17]</small></a> The
name must be painted on the stern in the same manner, under penalty of
$20.<a href="#note18" name="noteref18">
<small>[18]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
If any vessel licensed for the fisheries engages in any other business
not expressly allowed by the license, she is forfeited.<a href="#note19" name="noteref19">
<small>[19]</small></a> Vessels,
however, licensed for the mackerel trade are not forfeited in
consequence of having been engaged in catching cod, or other fish; but
they are not entitled to the bounty allowed to vessels in the cod
fisheries.<a href="#note20" name="noteref20">
<small>[20]</small></a> The officers and at least three fourths of the crew of
every fishing vessel must be American citizens, or they can recover
none of the bounties.<a href="#note21" name="noteref21">
<small>[21]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Documents.</span>&#8212;Every registered vessel should have a
<i>certificate of registry</i>.<a href="#note22" name="noteref22">
<small>[22]</small></a> This is an abstract of the record
of registry, showing the names and residences of the owners, the place
where the vessel was built, with a particular description of the
vessel. This document shows the national character of the vessel, and
is important to prove neutrality in time of war between other powers.
For the same reasons, an enrolled vessel should have a <i>certificate
of enrolment</i>.<a href="#note23" name="noteref23">
<small>[23]</small></a> Vessels bound to Europe should have
<i>passports</i>. A passport is a permission from the government for
the vessel to go upon her voyage, and contains a description of the
vessel, crew, &#38;c., and the name of the master. Vessels bound round Cape
Horn or the Cape of Good Hope should have <i>sea-letters</i>. These
contain a description of the cargo, &#38;c., and are written in four
languages&#8212;English, French, Dutch and Spanish. The two latter documents
are rendered necessary or expedient by reason of treaties with foreign
powers. Every vessel should have a <i>list of crew</i>. This specifies
the name, age, place of birth and residence, &#38;c., of each one of the
ship's company; and is, of course, very useful when sailing among
belligerents. The other documents are the <i>bill of health</i>,
<i>general clearance</i>, <i>clearing manifest</i>, <i>invoice</i> and
<i>bill of lading</i> for the cargo, <i>charter-party</i>, if one has
been given, and the <i>log-book</i>. On entering at the custom-house,
the papers required in addition to these are the <i>manifest</i>,
<i>list of passengers</i> and <i>crew</i>, and of <i>remaining
sea-stores</i>.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Medicine-chest.</span>&#8212;Every vessel belonging to citizens of the
United States, of the burden of one hundred and fifty tons or upwards,
navigated by ten or more persons in the whole, and bound on a foreign
voyage, must be provided with a medicine-chest, put up by some
apothecary of known reputation, and accompanied by directions for using
the same. This chest must be examined and refitted by the same or some
other apothecary at least once in a year.<a href="#note24" name="noteref24">
<small>[24]</small></a> The same rule applies to
vessels of seventy-five tons and upwards, navigated by six persons in
the whole, and bound to the West Indies.<a href="#note25" name="noteref25">
<small>[25]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">National Character of Crew.</span>&#8212;In order to be placed upon the
most favorable footing as to duties, bounties, &#38;c., it is necessary
that the master, officers, and two thirds of the rest of the crew of
vessels in the foreign trade, and officers and three fourths of the
crew of fishing and coasting vessels, should be citizens, or "persons
not the subjects of any foreign prince or state."<a href="#note26" name="noteref26">
<small>[26]</small></a> Nevertheless,
while foreigners are employed in our vessels, they are under the
protection of our laws as "mariners and seamen of the United
States."<a href="#note27" name="noteref27">
<small>[27]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Provisions.</span>&#8212;Every vessel of the United States bound on a
voyage across the Atlantic, shall, at the time of leaving the last port
from which she sails, have on board, well secured under deck, at least
sixty gallons of water, one hundred pounds of salted beef, and one
hundred pounds of wholesome ship bread, for every person on board,
(over and above any stores that the master or passengers may have put
on board;) and in like proportions for shorter or longer voyages. If
any vessel is not so provided, and the crew are put upon short
allowance of bread, flesh or water, they can recover an additional
day's wages for every day they are so allowanced.<a href="#note28" name="noteref28">
<small>[28]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Passengers.</span>&#8212;The same provision, with the addition of one
gallon of vinegar, must be made for every passenger; and if, in default
of these, the passengers are put on short allowance, each passenger can
recover three dollars for every day he is so allowanced.<a href="#note29" name="noteref29">
<small>[29]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
If any vessel takes on board a greater number of passengers than two
for every five tons, custom-house measurement, the master forfeits $150
for every such passenger; and if the number by which they exceed two
for every five tons shall amount to twenty, the vessel becomes
forfeited.<a href="#note30" name="noteref30">

<p>
<span class="sc">Revenue Duties and Obligations.</span>&#8212;The master of every vessel
bound on a foreign voyage, before clearance, must give to the collector
of the customs a list of the crew, specifying their names, places of
birth and residence, and containing a description of their persons;
whereupon he is entitled to a certified copy of the same from the
collector. This copy he must deliver, under a penalty of $400, to the
first boarding officer upon his arrival in the United States, and
produce the persons named therein, unless the same have been discharged
in a foreign country, with the consent of the consul or other
commercial agent thereto certified in writing under his hand and
official seal; or by showing that they have died or absconded, or been
impressed into foreign service.<a href="#note31" name="noteref31">
<small>[31]</small></a> The duplicate list of the crew
shall be a fair copy, in one uniform handwriting, without erasure or
interlineation.<a href="#note32" name="noteref32">
<small>[32]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
The owners must also obtain from the collector of the customs a
certified copy of the shipping articles. This must be produced by the
master before any consul or commercial agent who may demand it, and all
erasures in it or writings in a different hand shall be deemed
fraudulent, unless satisfactorily explained.<a href="#note33" name="noteref33">
<small>[33]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
The master of every vessel of the United States, on arriving at a
foreign port, must deposit with the consul, or other commercial agent,
his certificate of registry, sea letter, and passport (if he have one,)
under a penalty of $500. The consul returns them to him, upon his
obtaining a clearance.<a href="#note34" name="noteref34">
<small>[34]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
Upon arriving in the United States, the master must report to the
collector a list of passengers, specifying their names, age, sex,
occupation, the country of which they are citizens, and that in which
they intend to reside. This is under a penalty of $500.<a href="#note35" name="noteref35">
<small>[35]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
Vessels arriving from foreign ports must unlade and deliver their
cargoes between sunrise and sunset, unless by special permission of the
collector of the port.
</p>

<p>
In making out manifests of cargoes, the master must specify what
articles are to be deemed <i>sea stores</i>, and declare the same upon
oath. If the collector deems the amount excessive, he may charge them
with a duty. If the cargo is found to exceed the manifest, the excess
is forfeited to the government, and the master is liable to pay treble
the amount.<a href="#note36" name="noteref36">
<small>[36]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
If the master land any of the <i>sea stores</i>, without first
obtaining a permit, such stores are forfeited, and the master becomes
liable to pay treble the value of them.<a href="#note37" name="noteref37">
<small>[37]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
The master subjects himself to a fine of $200 if the vessel departs on
a foreign voyage without a <i>passport</i>.
</p>

<p>
It is the duty of the master, coming from a foreign port, to have a
<i>manifest</i> of cargo and a copy of the same made out and ready for
delivery to any officer of the customs who may board the vessel within
four leagues of the coast.<a href="#note38" name="noteref38">
<small>[38]</small></a> Unless this manifest is produced, no
merchandise can be unloaded from the vessel. The manifest shall specify
the port where the merchandise was received, the port to which it is
consigned, the name, build and description of the vessel, with the name
of the master and owner, the marks and numbers of each package of
goods, with the name of the consignee; and also the names of the
passengers with their baggage, and the account of all remaining sea
stores.<a href="#note39" name="noteref39">
<small>[39]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
If any goods are unladed within four leagues of the coast, or within
the limits of any district, without authority from the proper officer,
except in case of accident or necessity&#8212;which must be strictly
proved&#8212;such goods are forfeited, and the master and mate incur,
respectively, a penalty of $1000 for each offence.<a href="#note40" name="noteref40">
<small>[40]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
If the master refuses to exhibit his manifest and deliver a copy of the
same to the boarding officer, or to inform him of the true destination
of the vessel, he incurs a penalty of $500 for each offence.<a href="#note41" name="noteref41">
<small>[41]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
The master must deposit all his letters in the post-office before
entering his cargo; and if he shall break bulk before depositing his
letters, he forfeits $100 for each offence.<a href="#note42" name="noteref42">
<small>[42]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
If any merchandise is imported into the United States not contained in
the manifest, the master of the vessel forfeits a sum equal to the
value of such merchandise; and if any of it belongs or is consigned to
the master, or to any officer or seaman on board, it becomes forfeited;
unless it shall be made to appear that the omission occurred by
accident or mistake.<a href="#note43" name="noteref43">
<small>[43]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
The master of a vessel arriving from a foreign port must report himself
to the collector within twenty-four hours, and within forty-eight hours
he must make a further and more particular report, in writing, under
penalty of $100; and if he shall attempt to leave the port without
entry he forfeits $400.<a href="#note44" name="noteref44">
<small>[44]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
If any articles reported in the manifest are not found on board, the
master forfeits $500, unless it shall be made to appear that the same
was caused by accident or mistake.
</p>

<p>
The master of every vessel bound on a foreign voyage must deliver a
manifest of cargo to the collector, and obtain a clearance, under
penalty of $500.<a href="#note45" name="noteref45">
<small>[45]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
The master of every vessel enrolled and licensed in the coasting trade
must be a citizen of the United States; and if the vessel trades to any
other than an adjoining state, three fourths of the crew must be
citizens. If the master of a coasting vessel is changed, such change
must be reported to the collector of the port where the change is
made.<a href="#note46" name="noteref46">
<small>[46]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
The master of every coasting vessel must deliver up his license within
three days after it expired, or, if the vessel was then at sea, within
three days after her first arrival thereafter, under a penalty of $50.
</p>

<p>
The master of a coasting vessel departing from one great district to
another, must deliver to the collector duplicate manifests of all the
cargo on board, under penalty of $50; and within forty-eight hours
after his arrival at the port of delivery, and before breaking bulk, he
must deliver to the collector the manifest certified to by the
collector of the former port, under penalty of $100.<a href="#note47" name="noteref47">
<small>[47]</small></a> If the vessel
shall at any time be found without a manifest on board, the master
forfeits $20, and if he refuses to inform the officer of his last port
of departure, he forfeits $100.<a href="#note48" name="noteref48">
<small>[48]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Power to sell and hypothecate.</span>&#8212;The master has, in certain
cases, power to hypothecate the ship and cargo, and also to sell a part
of the cargo; and in certain extreme cases a sale of the ship and
cargo, made from necessity, and in the utmost good faith, will be
upheld. His right to do any of these acts is confined to cases of
necessity, in distant ports, where he cannot get the advice of the
owner. The safest rule for the master is, to bear in mind that his duty
is to <i>prosecute the voyage</i>, and that all his acts must be done
for this purpose, and in good faith. If a necessity arises in a foreign
port for the repairing or supplying of the ship, he must, in the first
instance, make use of any property of the owner he may have under his
control, other than cargo.<a href="#note49" name="noteref49">
<small>[49]</small></a> If, however, he has money of the owner
in his hands, put on board for the purpose of procuring a cargo, he is
not bound to apply this first; but must use his discretion, bearing in
mind that all repairs have for their sole object the prosecution of the
voyage, which might be defeated by making use of these funds.<a href="#note50" name="noteref50">
<small>[50]</small></a> His
next recourse should be to the personal credit of the owner, by drawing
bills, or otherwise.<a href="#note51" name="noteref51">
<small>[51]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
If these means fail, he is next to hypothecate (that is, pledge) the
ship (bottomry,) or cargo (respondentia,) or freight, or sell part of
the cargo, according to circumstances. If the owner of the ship is also
owner of the cargo, the better opinion seems to be, that the master may
take whichever of these means can be adopted with the least sacrifice
of the owner's interest; though, probably, selling part of the cargo
would in almost all cases be the least favorable course for all the
purposes of the voyage.<a href="#note52" name="noteref52">
<small>[52]</small></a> If the owner of the ship is not owner of
the cargo, the master should bear in mind that he is agent of the
former, and has generally no further control over the cargo than for
safe keeping and transportation.<a href="#note53" name="noteref53">
<small>[53]</small></a> He should, therefore, first
exhaust the credit of the ship and freight by hypothecation; and if
these means fail, he then becomes, by necessity, agent for the owners
of the cargo for the purposes of the voyage, and may hypothecate the
whole, or sell a part, according to circumstances. As to selling part,
he should remember that his duty is to carry forward the objects of the
voyage, and that selling a large part would probably impair these
objects more than hypothecating the whole.<a href="#note54" name="noteref54">
<small>[54]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
In no case can any of the cargo be sold or hypothecated to repair or
supply the ship, unless these repairs and supplies are to be for the
benefit of the cargo. The strictest proof is always required that the
repairs were in the first place necessary, and, in the next place, that
they were for the benefit of the cargo, and not merely for the good of
the ship-owner.<a href="#note55" name="noteref55">
<small>[55]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
A further question arises, whether the master has ever, and when, the
right to sell the whole cargo and the ship itself. If it should be
impossible to repair the ship and send her on the voyage by any of the
means before mentioned, it then becomes the master's duty to forward
the cargo to the port of destination by some other conveyance. If
neither of these things can be done, then he becomes, from necessity,
agent of the owner of the cargo, and must make the best disposition of
it in his power. If the goods are perishable, the owner cannot be
consulted within a reasonable time, and has no agent in the port, and
something must be done with the cargo, and there is no one else to
act&#8212;then the master must dispose of it in such a way as best to
subserve the interest of its owner. He should take the advice of the
commercial agent or other suitable persons, should also use his own
judgment and act with good faith, and take care to preserve evidence
that he has so done. If all these requisites are not complied with, he
will incur the danger of having his acts set aside.<a href="#note56" name="noteref56">
<small>[56]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
The rule as to the sale of the ship is very nearly the same, except
that it is, perhaps, still more strict. If all means for repairing the
vessel and sending her on her voyage have failed, and a case of
absolute necessity arises, the master may make a sale of her. As a
prudent man, he should have the sale made, if possible, under the
authority of the judicial tribunals of the place. Even this will not,
of itself, render the sale valid, but will go far toward sustaining it.
He should consult the consul, or other suitable persons; should have a
survey made; should take care to have the sale conducted publicly and
with the best faith in all parties, and to preserve evidence of the
same. Although a person should buy in good faith, yet the sale will be
set aside unless it can be shown that there was the strictest necessity
for it. The master must not become a purchaser himself, and even if he
afterwards buys of one who purchased at the sale, this transaction will
be very narrowly watched, and he will be bound to show the very highest
good faith in all parties.<a href="#note57" name="noteref57">
<small>[57]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
The strictness of these rules should not deter the master from acting,
where the interest of all requires it, but will show him the risk that
is run by acting otherwise than with prudence and entire honesty. He
should remember, too, that, in taking command of a vessel, he not only
covenants that he will act honestly and with the best of his judgment,
but also holds himself out as having a reasonable degree of skill and
prudence.<a href="#note58" name="noteref58">
<small>[58]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
As to the safe keeping, transportation, and delivery of the cargo, the
master's duties and obligations are those of a common carrier upon
land. He is bound to the strictest diligence in commencing and
prosecuting the voyage, a high degree of care both of vessel and goods,
and is held liable for all losses and injuries not occasioned by
inevitable accident, or by the acts of public enemies. He is answerable
also for unnecessary delays and deviations, and for the wrongful or
negligent acts of all persons under his command. At the termination of
the voyage, he must deliver the goods to the consignee or his agents. A
landing upon the wharf is a sufficient delivery, if due notice be given
to the parties who are to receive them. He is not, however, bound to
deliver until the freight due is paid or secured to his satisfaction,
as he has a lien upon the goods for his freight; but the consignee can
require the goods to be taken from the hold, in order that he may
examine them, before paying freight. In such case they should not go
out of the possession of the master or his agents.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Deviation.</span>&#8212;The master must not deviate from the course of the
voyage. By a <i>deviation</i> is meant, technically, any alteration of
the risk insured against, without necessity or reasonable cause. It may
be by departing from the regular and usual course of the voyage, or by
any unusual and unnecessary delay. A deviation renders the insurance
void, whether the loss of the vessel is caused by the deviation or not.
It is not a deviation to make a port for repairs or supplies, if there
be no unnecessary delay, nor to depart from the course of the voyage in
order to succor persons in distress, to avoid an enemy, or the like.
</p>

<p>
It is the master's duty, within twenty-four hours after arriving at his
first port, to make a <i>protest</i> in case of any accident or loss
happening to vessel or cargo. The log-book also should be carefully
kept, without interlineations or erasures. The master must also enter a
protest in case any American seaman is impressed, and transmit a copy
of the same to the secretary of state, under a penalty of $100.<a href="#note59" name="noteref59">
<small>[59]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Collision.</span>&#8212;A vessel having the wind free must make way for a
vessel close-hauled. The general practice is, that when two vessels
approach each other, both having a free or fair wind, the one with the
starboard tacks aboard keeps on her course, or, if any change is made,
she luffs, so as to pass to windward of the other; or, in other words,
each vessel passes to the right. This rule should also govern vessels
sailing on the wind and approaching each other, when it is doubtful
which is to windward. But if the vessel on the larboard tack is so far
to windward that if both persist in their course the other will strike
her on the lee side, abaft the beam, or near the stern; in such case,
the vessel on the starboard tack must give way, as she can do so with
less loss of time and greater facility than the other. These rules are
particularly intended to govern vessels approaching each other under
circumstances that prevent their course and movements being readily
discerned with accuracy, as at night or in a fog. At other times,
circumstances may render it expedient to depart from them. A steamer is
considered as always sailing with a fair wind, and is bound to do
whatever would be required of a vessel going free.<a href="#note60" name="noteref60">
<small>[60]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Pilot.</span>&#8212;The master must take a pilot when within the usual
limits of the pilot's employment.<a href="#note61" name="noteref61">
<small>[61]</small></a> If he neglects or refuses so to
do, he becomes liable to the owners, freighters, and insurers. If no
pilot is at hand, he must make signals, and wait a reasonable time. The
master is to be justified in entering port without a pilot only by
extreme necessity. After the pilot is on board, the master has no more
control over the working of the ship until she is at anchor.<a href="#note62" name="noteref62">
<small>[62]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Wages, Advances, &#38;c.</span>&#8212;The master has no lien upon the ship for
his wages.<a href="#note63" name="noteref63"><small>[63]</small></a>
 He is supposed to look to the personal responsibility of
the owner. He has a lien on freight for wages, and also for his
advances and necessary expenses incurred for the benefit of the
ship.<a href="#note64" name="noteref64"><small>[64]</small></a>
 He can sue in admiralty <i>in personam</i>, but not <i>in
rem</i>;&#8212;that is, he can sue the owner personally, but cannot hold the
ship. It does not seem to be settled in the United States whether the
master has a lien on the ship for advances made abroad for the benefit
of the vessel.<a href="#note65" name="noteref65"><small>[65]</small></a>
 In case of sickness, the master's right to be cured
at the expense of the ship seems to be the same as that of the
seamen.<a href="#note66" name="noteref66"><small>[66]</small></a>

CHAPTER III.
</p>

<p class="head">
THE MASTER'S RELATION TO PASSENGERS AND OFFICERS.
</p>

<p class="subhead">
Treatment of passengers. Removal of officers.
</p>


<p>
<span class="sc">Passengers.</span>&#8212;The contract of passengers with the master is not
for mere ship-room and personal existence on board, but for reasonable
food, comforts, necessaries, and kindness. In respect to females, it
extends still further, and includes an implied stipulation against
obscenity, immodesty, and a wanton disregard of the feelings. An
improper course of conduct in these particulars will be punished by the
court, as much as a personal assault would be.<a href="#note67" name="noteref67"><small>[67]</small></a>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Officers.</span>&#8212;The master may remove either of his officers from
duty for fraudulent or unfaithful conduct, for gross negligence and
disobedience, or for palpable incapacity. But the causes of removal
must be strong and evident;<a href="#note68" name="noteref68"><small>[68]</small></a>
 and much more so in the case of the
chief mate than of the second mate. Any temporary appointments, made by
the master, are held at his pleasure, and stand upon a different
footing from those of persons who originally shipped in the character
in question.<a href="#note69" name="noteref69"><small>[69]</small></a>

</p>

<p>
When a man ships in a particular capacity, as carpenter, steward, or
the like, he is not to be degraded for slight causes. He stipulates for
fair and reasonable knowledge and due diligence, but not for
extraordinary qualifications.<a href="#note70" name="noteref70"><small>[70]</small></a>

</p>

<p>
The right of the master to compel an officer, who has been removed, to
do duty as a seaman before the mast, has never been completely
established; but the better opinion would seem to be that he may do it
in a case of necessity. Merchant vessels have no supernumeraries, and
if the master can show that the officer was unfit for the duties he had
undertaken, and thus made it necessary to take some one from the
forecastle to fill his place, and that, by this means, the ship had
become short-handed, he may turn the officer forward, assuming the
responsibility for the act, as well as the risk of justification. He
would be required to show a much stronger cause for removing the chief
mate than would be insisted upon in the case of a second mate; and
probably this necessity for exacting seaman's duty would be held to
extend no further than an arrival at the first port where other hands
could be shipped.
</p>

<p>
Nothing but evident unfitness or gross and repeated misconduct will
justify the master in turning a person forward who shipped in another
capacity, as carpenter, cook, or steward. But in such cases, he
undoubtedly may do so. Still, when before the mast, he cannot require
of them the duty of able seamen, unless they are such in fact.

<p class="head">
THE MASTER'S RELATION TO THE CREW.
</p>

<p class="subhead">
Shipment. Shipping papers. Discharge. Imprisonment. Punishment.
</p>


<p>
<span class="sc">Shipment.</span>&#8212;The master of every vessel of the United States,
bound on a foreign voyage, and of all coasting vessels of fifty tons
burden, must make a contract in writing (shipping articles) with each
seaman, specifying the voyage, terms of time, &#38;c.; and in default
thereof shall forfeit $20 for every case of omission, and shall be
obliged to pay every such seaman the highest rate of wages that have
been paid for such voyages at the port of shipment within three months
previous to the commencement of the voyage.<a href="#note71" name="noteref71"><small>[71]</small></a> And when the master
ships a seaman in a foreign port, he must take the list of crew and the
duplicate of the shipping articles to the consul or commercial agent,
who shall make the proper entries thereupon; and then the bond
originally given for the return of the men shall embrace each person so
shipped. All shipments made contrary to this or any other act of
Congress shall be void, and the seaman may leave at any time, and claim
the highest rate of wages paid for any man who shipped for the voyage,
or the sum agreed to be given him at his shipment.<a href="#note72" name="noteref72"><small>[72]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
At the foot of every such contract there shall be a memorandum of
writing of the day and hour on which such seaman shall render himself
on board. If this memorandum is made and the seaman neglects to render
himself on board at the time specified, he shall forfeit one day's pay
for every hour he is so absent, provided the master or mate shall, on
the same day, have made an entry of the name of such seaman in the
log-book, specifying the time he was so absent. And if the seaman shall
wholly neglect to render himself on board, or, after rendering, shall
desert before sailing, so that the vessel goes to sea without him, he
then forfeits the amount of his advance and a further sum equal
thereto, both of which may be recovered from himself or his surety.<a href="#note73" name="noteref73"><small>[73]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
There is no obligation upon the master to make these memorandums and
entries, other than that the forfeitures cannot be inflicted upon the
seamen unless they have been made literally according to the form of
the statute.
</p>

<p>
If any seaman who has signed the articles shall desert during the
voyage, the master may have him arrested and committed to jail until
the vessel is ready to proceed, by applying to a justice of the peace
and proving the contract, and the breach thereof by the seaman.<a href="#note74" name="noteref74"><small>[74]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
Every vessel bound on a foreign voyage shall have on board a duplicate
list of the crew, and a true copy of the shipping-articles, certified
by the collector of the port, containing the names of the crew, which
shall be written in a uniform hand, without erasures or
interlineations. This copy the master must produce to any consul or
commercial agent of the United States who shall require it; and it
shall be deemed to contain all the conditions of the contract. All
erasures and interlineations shall be deemed fraudulent unless proved
to be innocent and bon&#226; fide. Every master who shall go upon a foreign
voyage without these documents, or shall refuse to produce them when
required, shall forfeit one hundred dollars for each offence, beside
being liable in damages to any seaman who may have been injured
thereby.<a href="#note75" name="noteref75"><small>[75]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Discharge.</span>&#8212;If the master discharges any seaman in a foreign
port, with his own consent, he shall pay to the consul three months'
wages for every such seaman, in addition to the wages then due to him,
two-thirds to go to the seaman upon his taking passage for the United
States, and the remainder to be retained by the consul to make a fund
for the relief of destitute seamen.<a href="#note76" name="noteref76"><small>[76]</small></a> The master of every vessel
bound to the United States shall, upon the request of the consul, take
on board any seaman and transport him to the United States, on terms
not exceeding ten dollars for each seaman, under penalty of one hundred
dollars for every refusal. He is not, however, bound to receive more
than two men to every hundred tons.<a href="#note77" name="noteref77"><small>[77]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
The whole policy of the United States discourages the discharge of
seamen in foreign ports. If the seaman is discharged against his
consent, and without justifiable cause, he can recover his wages up to
the time of the vessel's return, together with his own expenses. The
certificate of the consul will not, of itself, prove the sufficiency of
the cause of discharge. Though the seaman shall have made himself
liable to be discharged, yet if he repents and offers to return to
duty, the master must receive him, unless he can show a sufficient
cause of refusal.<a href="#note78" name="noteref78"><small>[78]</small></a> If the master alleges, as a cause for discharging
a seaman, that he was a dangerous man, it must be shown that the danger
was such as would affect a man of ordinary firmness.<a href="#note79" name="noteref79"><small>[79]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
In addition to the master's liability to the seaman, he is criminally
liable to the government for discharging a mariner without cause. The
statute enacts that if the master shall, when abroad, force on shore or
leave behind any officer or seaman without justifiable cause, he shall
be fined not exceeding five hundred dollars, or imprisoned not
exceeding six months, according to the aggravation of the offence.<a href="#note80" name="noteref80"><small>[80]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding these liabilities, the master may discharge a seaman
for gross misconduct; yet the right is very strictly construed.<a href="#note81" name="noteref81"><small>[81]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Imprisonment.</span>&#8212;The master has the right to imprison a seaman
in a foreign port, in a case of urgent necessity, but the power has
always been very closely watched by courts of law. "The practice of
imprisoning seamen in foreign jails is one of doubtful legality, and is
to be justified only by a strong case of necessity."<a href="#note82" name="noteref82"><small>[82]</small></a> "The master is
not authorized to punish a seaman by imprisonment in a foreign jail
unless in cases of aggravated misconduct and insubordination."<a href="#note83" name="noteref83"><small>[83]</small></a> If
he does so punish him, he is not permitted to deduct his wages during
the time of imprisonment, nor charge him with the expense of it.<a href="#note84" name="noteref84"><small>[84]</small></a> If
the imprisonment is without justifiable cause, the master is not
excused by showing that it was ordered by the consul.<a href="#note85" name="noteref85"><small>[85]</small></a> And,
generally, the advice of a consul is no justification of an illegal
act.<a href="#note86" name="noteref86"><small>[86]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Punishment.</span>&#8212;The master may inflict moderate correction on a
seaman for sufficient cause; but he must take care that it is not
disproportionate to the offence. If he exceeds the bounds of moderation
he is treated as a trespasser, and is liable in damages.<a href="#note87" name="noteref87"><small>[87]</small></a> In respect
to the mode of correction, it may be by personal chastisement, or by
confinement on board ship, in irons, or otherwise.<a href="#note88" name="noteref88"><small>[88]</small></a> But there must
not be any cruelty or unnecessary severity exercised. The mode,
instruments or extent of the punishment are not laid down by law. These
must depend upon circumstances. In cases of urgent necessity, as of
mutiny, weapons may be used which would be unlawful at other times; but
even in these cases, they must be used with the caution which the law
requires in other cases of self-defence and vindication of rightful
authority.<a href="#note89" name="noteref89"><small>[89]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
It is not necessary that the punishment should be inflicted to suppress
the offence at the time of its commission. It may be inflicted for past
offences, and to promote good discipline on board. But the reference to
by-gone acts should be very clear and distinct, or they will be
presumed to have been forgiven.<a href="#note90" name="noteref90"><small>[90]</small></a> In many cases prudence may require
a postponement of the proper punishment. The authority of the master,
being in its nature parental, must be exercised with a due regard to
the rights and interests of all parties. He has a large discretion, but
is held to answer strictly for every abuse of it.<a href="#note91" name="noteref91"><small>[91]</small></a> The law enjoins
upon him a temperate demeanor and decent conduct towards seamen. He
risks the consequences if he commences a dispute with illegal conduct
and improper behavior.<a href="#note92" name="noteref92"><small>[92]</small></a> In all his acts of correction, he must
punish purely for reformation and discipline, and never to gratify
personal feelings.<a href="#note93" name="noteref93"><small>[93]</small></a> If a master generally permits or encourages
disorderly behavior in his ship, he is less excusable for inflicting
unusual punishment on account of misconduct arising out of that
disorder.<a href="#note94" name="noteref94"><small>[94]</small></a> If the case admits of delay, and the master does not make
proper inquiry before punishing, he takes the consequences upon
himself.<a href="#note95" name="noteref95"><small>[95]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
This power over the liberty and person of a fellow man, being against
common right, and intrusted to the master only from public policy,
regarding the necessities of the service, is to be sparingly used, and
a strict account will be required of its exercise. The master is
responsible for any punishment inflicted on board the vessel, unless in
his absence, or when he is prevented by force from interfering.<a href="#note96" name="noteref96"><small>[96]</small></a>
Neither will absence always be an excuse. If he had reason to suppose
that such a thing might be done, and did not take pains to be present
and interfere, he will be liable. Neither, (as is often supposed,) will
the advice, or even the personal superintendence or orders of a consul,
or any foreign authority, relieve the master of his personal
responsibility.<a href="#note97" name="noteref97"><small>[97]</small></a> He may ask advice, but he must act upon his own
account, and is equally answerable for what he does himself, and what
he permits to be done on board his vessel by others. The seaman is
entitled to be dealt with by his own captain, under whom he shipped,
and whom he may hold responsible at the end of the voyage; and this
responsibility is not to be shaken off by calling in the aid of others.
In case of an open mutiny, or of imminent danger to life and property,
the master may make use of the local authorities; but then he is to
remember that he can use them no further than for the purpose of
quelling the mutiny, or of apprehending the felon. As soon as his
authority is restored, the parental character is again thrown upon him,
and all acts of punishment must be upon his own responsibility. He has
no right to punish criminally. He has no judicial power. If a seaman
has committed an offence further than against the internal order and
economy of the ship, and which moderate correction is not sufficient to
meet, the master must bring him home, (in confinement, if necessary,)
or send him immediately by some other vessel, to be tried by the laws
and by a jury of his country.<a href="#note98" name="noteref98"><small>[98]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
The practice of subjecting American seamen to foreign authority, or to
persons whom they cannot well hold answerable,&#8212;like that of foreign
imprisonment,&#8212;is an odious one, and must be justified by an
overpowering necessity.
</p>

<p>
A recent statute<a href="#note99" name="noteref99"><small>[99]</small></a> makes it the duty of consuls to exert themselves
to reclaim deserters and discountenance insubordination, and authorizes
them to employ the local authorities, where it can usefully be done,
for those purposes. But this will unquestionably be restricted to the
apprehension of the deserter, and the quelling of the revolt or mutiny;
and as soon as these ends are attained, the sole responsibility of the
master in dealing with the crew will re-attach.
</p>

<p>
If the master is present while the mate, or any subordinate officer,
inflicts punishment upon any of the crew, or if it is inflicted under
such circumstances as would raise a presumption that the master was
knowing of it, and he does not interfere, he will be held to have
adopted it as his own act, and will be answerable accordingly.<a href="#note100" name="noteref100"><small>[100]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
In addition to the master's liability to the seamen in damages for
abuse of power, he is also liable, as a criminal, to fine and
imprisonment. A recent statute enacts, that "if any master, or other
officer, of an American vessel, shall, from malice, hatred, or revenge,
and without justifiable cause, beat, wound, or imprison any one or more
of the crew of such vessel, or withhold from them suitable food or
nourishment, or inflict on them any cruel or unusual punishment, every
such person so offending shall, on conviction thereof, be punished by
fine not exceeding one thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not
exceeding five years, or by both, according to the nature and
aggravation of the offence."<a href="#note101" name="noteref101"><small>[101]</small></a> It is held that the word 'crew,' in
this statute, includes officers; and accordingly a master was punished
for unjustifiably confining and otherwise mal-treating his chief
mate.<a href="#note102" name="noteref102"><small>[102]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
To constitute 'malice' in the above statute, it is not necessary to
show malignity as it is commonly understood, or brutality; but the
term, in law, requires no more than a 'wilful intention to do a
wrongful act.' An offence is punishable under this act, even although
no bad passions came into play, (as hatred, or revenge,) for the term
'malice,' in law, covers all cases of intentional wrong, in their
mildest form.<a href="#note103" name="noteref103"><small>[103]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
If a seaman desires to lay any complaint before a consul in a foreign
port, the master must permit him to land for that purpose, or else
inform the consul immediately of the fact, stating his reasons in
writing for not allowing the man to land. If he refuses to do this, he
forfeits one hundred dollars, and is liable to the seaman in
damages.<a href="#note104" name="noteref104"><small>[104]</small></a>

<p class="head">
PASSENGERS.
</p>

<p class="subhead">
Provisions. Treatment. Passage-money. Deportment. Services.
</p>


<p>
In Chapter I. of the Third Part, under the title "Provisions," it will
be seen that the vessel must have on board, well secured under deck, at
least sixty gallons of water, one hundred pounds of salted beef, one
hundred pounds of wholesome ship bread, and one gallon of vinegar for
each passenger, on a voyage across the Atlantic, and in like proportion
for shorter or longer voyages. This, too, must be in addition to the
private stores of the master or passengers.<a href="#note105" name="noteref105"><small>[105]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
The master is also forbidden to take on board more than two passengers
for every five tons.<a href="#note106" name="noteref106"><small>[106]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
The contract of passengers with the master is not for mere ship-room
and personal existence on board, but for reasonable food, comforts,
necessaries, and kindness. In respect to females it extends yet
farther, and includes an implied stipulation against obscenity,
immodesty, and a wanton disregard of the feelings. A course of conduct
oppressive and malicious in these respects will be punished by the
court, as well as a personal assault.<a href="#note107" name="noteref107"><small>[107]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
No passage-money is due to a ship upon an engagement to transport a
passenger, before the arrival of the vessel at the port of destination.
Where the passenger has paid in advance, he can reclaim his money if
the voyage is not performed. If a voyage is partially performed, no
passage-money is due, unless the expenses of the passenger, or the
means of proceeding to the place of destination, are paid or tendered
to him; in which case, passage-money in proportion to the progress in
the voyage is payable.<a href="#note108" name="noteref108"><small>[108]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
A passenger must submit to the reasonable rules and usages of the ship.
He has no right to interfere with its discipline and internal
regulations. Indeed, in a case of necessity, and for the order and
safety of the ship, the master may restrain a passenger by force; but
the cause must be urgent, and the manner reasonable and moderate.
</p>

<p>
In case of danger and distress, it is the duty as well as the interest
of the passenger to contribute his aid, according to his ability, and
he is entitled to no compensation therefor. He is not, however, bound
to remain on board in time of danger, but may leave the vessel if he
can; much less is he required to take upon himself any responsibility
as to the conduct of the ship. If, therefore, he performs any
extraordinary services, he becomes entitled to salvage.<a href="#note109" name="noteref109"><small>[109]</small></a>

CHAPTER VI.
</p>

<p class="head">
MATES AND SUBORDINATES.
</p>

<p class="subhead">
Mates included in the 'crew.' Removal. Succession. Log-book Wages.
Sickness. Punishment. Subordinates. Pilots.
</p>


<p>
In all the statutes which entitle the 'crew,' or the 'seamen,' of a
vessel to certain privileges as against the master or owner, these
words, 'crew' and 'seamen,' are construed to include the mates; as, for
instance, the statute requiring a certain amount of provisions to be on
board; the statute requiring a medicine-chest, and that which punishes
the master for illegal and cruel treatment of any of the crew. In all
these cases the mates are entitled to the same privileges and
protection with the seamen.<a href="#note11" name="noteref110"><small>[110]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
The <i>chief mate</i> is usually put on board by the owner, and is a
person who is looked to for extraordinary services and responsibility.
Accordingly, he cannot be removed by the master, unless for repeated
and aggravated misconduct, or for palpable incapacity.<a href="#note111" name="noteref111"><small>[111]</small></a> He acts in
the stead of the master in case the latter dies, and whenever he is
absent.<a href="#note112" name="noteref112"><small>[112]</small></a> He is then entrusted with the care of the ship, and the
government of the crew. If he is appointed to act as mate by the master
during the voyage, he holds his office at the master's pleasure;<a href="#note113" name="noteref113"><small>[113]</small></a>
but if he originally shipped in that capacity, he cannot be removed
without proof of gross and flagrant misconduct, or of evident
unfitness. Nor will one or two single instances of intemperance,
disobedience or negligence, be sufficient; the misconduct must be
repeated, and the habit apparently incorrigible.<a href="#note114" name="noteref114"><small>[114]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
The second mate and other inferior officers do not stand upon so firm a
footing as the chief mate; yet they cannot be removed by the master,
unless for gross and repeated acts of disobedience, intemperance,
dishonesty or negligence, or for palpable incapacity.
</p>

<p>
In case of the death or absence of the master, the chief mate becomes
master by operation of law, but the second mate does not necessarily
become chief mate. It lies with the new master to appoint whom he
pleases to act as chief mate; though, in most cases, it should be the
second mate, unless good reason exists for the contrary course. The
second mate cannot, however, be degraded by the new master for any
other cause than would have justified the former in so doing.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Log-book.</span>&#8212;It is the duty of the chief mate to keep the
log-book of the ship. This should be neatly and carefully kept, and all
interlineations and erasures should be avoided, as they always raise
suspicion. The entries should be made as soon as possible after each
event takes place, and nothing should be entered which the mate would
not be willing to adhere to in a court of justice. (See page 145.)
</p>

<p>
In Chapter III. of the Third Part, under the title, "Master's relation
to Officers," page 188, will be found a discussion of the question,
whether the master can compel an officer to do duty before the mast.
</p>

<p>
In Chapters VIII., X., XI. and XII. of Part III., under the titles,
"Revolt," "Forfeiture," "Desertion," &#38;c., will be found the laws upon
those subjects relating to seamen. And it may be generally remarked,
that all those laws apply as well to the officers as to the foremast
men. An officer forfeits his wages by desertion, and is criminally
liable for mutiny, revolt, &#38;c., like a common seaman. As to the
questions what constitutes a revolt, mutiny, &#38;c., and when absence or
leaving a vessel is excusable, and when it works a forfeiture, and as
to when wages are due, I would refer the reader to those titles in
Chapters VIII., X., XI. and XII. of Part III., above referred to.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Wages.</span>&#8212;Officers may sue in admiralty for their wages, and may
arrest the ship, into whoseever hands it may have passed;<a href="#note115" name="noteref115"><small>[115]</small></a> which is
not the case with the master, who is supposed to look solely to the
personal responsibility of the owners.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Sickness.</span>&#8212;The right of an officer to be cured at the ship's
expense is the same as that of a seaman.<a href="#note116" name="noteref116"><small>[116]</small></a> The law upon that subject
will be found in Chapter IX., title "Sickness," page 207.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Punishment.</span>&#8212;The laws of the United States provide that if any
master or officer shall unjustifiably beat, wound, or imprison any of
the crew, or withhold from them suitable food and nourishment, or
inflict upon them any cruel and unusual punishment, he shall be
imprisoned not exceeding five years, and fined not exceeding $1000 for
each offence.<a href="#note117" name="noteref117"><small>[117]</small></a> The officers, as part of the 'crew,' are entitled to
the protection of this statute, against the master's acts; and, on the
other hand, they are liable under it for any abuse of a seaman.<a href="#note118" name="noteref118"><small>[118]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
The law as to the officer's right to punish a seaman has been clearly
settled, and is very simple. The sole authority to punish, for
correction and discipline, resides with the master.<a href="#note119" name="noteref119"><small>[119]</small></a> An officer has
no right to use force with a seaman, either by chastising or confining
him, except in a single class of cases; that is, upon an emergency
which admits of no delay, and where the use of force is necessary for
the safety of life and property. If a seaman is about to do an act
which may endanger life or property, and instant action is required,
the officer may confine him, or use force necessary to prevent him. So,
if the immediate execution of an order is important, and a seaman, by
obstinacy or wilful negligence, prevents or impedes the act, the
officer may use force necessary to secure the performance of the duty.
In these cases there must be a pressing necessity which will not admit
of delay; for if delay is practicable, the officer must report to the
master, and leave the duty of correction with him. A mate can in no
case punish a seaman for the general purposes of correction and
discipline, and still less for personal disrespect to himself.<a href="#note120" name="noteref120"><small>[120]</small></a> If
the master is not on board, and cannot be called upon, the authority of
the officer is somewhat enlarged; but, even in this case, so far as a
delay is practicable, he must leave the seaman to be dealt with by the
master when he returns. Except in the cases and in the manner before
mentioned, the officer is liable as a trespasser for any force used
with a seaman.
</p>

<p>
If the officer acts under the authority, express or implied, of the
master, he will not be held liable, even though the punishment should
be excessive and unjustifiable; for he is, in such cases, only the
agent of the master, who is responsible for the act.<a href="#note121" name="noteref121"><small>[121]</small></a> Yet, if the
punishment be so excessive as to show malice or wantonness on the part
of the officer, or there be anything in his conduct to imply the same,
he will be liable in some measure himself.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Subordinates.</span>&#8212;There are a number of men, usually, in merchant
vessels, who are not in any respect officers, but who differ from the
common seamen in that they ship in particular capacities, and to
perform certain duties. These are the carpenter, steward, cook, &#38;c.
Such persons are not to be degraded for slight causes, though the
master unquestionably has the power to do so, upon sufficient
grounds.<a href="#note122" name="noteref122"><small>[122]</small></a> He may also require them to do duty, if necessary, before
the mast. He may require them to take the place of persons who have
been obliged to do their work,<a href="#note123" name="noteref123"><small>[123]</small></a> but he cannot exact from them the
duty of able seamen, unless they are such in fact. Repeated acts of
disobedience, intemperance, and gross negligence, and evident
incapacity for the duties undertaken, are justifying causes of
removal.<a href="#note124" name="noteref124"><small>[124]</small></a> In all other respects this class of persons stands upon
the same footing with common seamen. They have the same privileges, and
are under the same obligations and penalties.<a href="#note125" name="noteref125"><small>[125]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Pilots.</span>&#8212;When a pilot, who is regularly appointed, is on

SEAMEN. SHIPPING CONTRACT.
</p>

<p class="subhead">
Shipping contract&#8212;how formed&#8212;how signed. Erasures and
interlineations. Unusual stipulations.
</p>


<p>
By the law of the United States, in all foreign voyages, and in all
coasting voyages to other than an adjoining state, there must be an
agreement in writing, or in print, with every seaman on board the ship,
(excepting only apprentices and servants of the master or owner,)
declaring the voyage, and term or terms of time, for which such seaman
is hired.<a href="#note133" name="noteref133"><small>[133]</small></a> This contract is called the <i>shipping-articles</i>,
and all the crew, including the master and officers, usually sign the
same paper; it not being requisite that there should be a separate
paper for each man. If there is not such a contract signed, each seaman
could, by the old law, recover the highest rate of wages that had been
given on similar voyages, at the port where he shipped, within three
months next before the time of shipment.<a href="#note134" name="noteref134"><small>[134]</small></a> By the law of 1840, he
may, in such case, leave the vessel at any time, and demand the highest
rate of wages given to any seaman during the voyage, or the rate agreed
upon at the time of his shipment.<a href="#note135" name="noteref135"><small>[135]</small></a> A seaman not signing the
articles, is not bound by any of the regulations, nor subject to the
penalties of the statutes;<a href="#note136" name="noteref136"><small>[136]</small></a> but he is, notwithstanding, bound by
the rules and liable to the forfeitures imposed by the general maritime
law.<a href="#note137" name="noteref137"><small>[137]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
These shipping-articles are legal evidence, and bind all parties whose
names are annexed to them, both as to wages, the nature and length of
the voyage, and the duties to be performed.<a href="#note138" name="noteref138"><small>[138]</small></a> Accordingly, seamen
have certain rights secured to them with reference to these papers. In
the first place, the master must obtain a copy of the articles,
certified to by the collector of the port from which the vessel sails,
to take with him upon the voyage. This must be a fair and true copy,
without erasures or interlineations. If there are any such erasures or
interlineations, they will be presumed to be fraudulent, and will be
set aside, unless they are satisfactorily explained in a manner
consistent with innocent purposes, and with the provisions of laws
which guard the rights of mariners. These articles must be produced by
the master before any consul or commercial agent to whom a seaman may
have submitted a complaint.<a href="#note139" name="noteref139"><small>[139]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
Every unusual clause introduced into the shipping-articles, or anything
which tends to deprive a seaman of what he would be entitled to by the
general law, will be suspiciously regarded by the courts; and if there
is reason to suppose that any advantage has been taken of him, or if
the contract bears unequally upon him, it will be set aside. In order
to sustain such a clause, the master or owner must show two things:
first, that the seaman's attention was directed toward it, and its
operation and effect explained to him; and, secondly, that he received
some additional compensation or privilege in consideration of the
clause. Unless the court is satisfied upon these two points, an unusual
stipulation unfavorable to a seaman will be set aside.<a href="#note140" name="noteref140"><small>[140]</small></a> For
instance, seamen are entitled to have a medicine-chest on board, and in
certain cases to be cured at the ship's expense; and the court set
aside a clause in the shipping-articles in which it was stipulated that
the seamen should bear all the expense, even though there were no
medicine-chest on board.<a href="#note141" name="noteref141"><small>[141]</small></a> Another clause was set aside, in which
the voyage was described as from Baltimore to St. Domingo and
<i>elsewhere</i>, on the ground that seamen are entitled to have their
voyage accurately described.<a href="#note142" name="noteref142"><small>[142]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
Some clauses which are not such as to be set aside, will yet be
construed in favor of seamen, if their interpretation is at all
doubtful.<a href="#note143" name="noteref143"><small>[143]</small></a> A clause providing that no wages should be paid if the
vessel should be taken or lost, or detained more than thirty days, was
set aside, seamen being entitled to wages up to the last port of
delivery.<a href="#note144" name="noteref144"><small>[144]</small></a> If the amount of wages merely be omitted in the
articles, there seems to be some doubt as to the introduction of other
evidence to show the rate agreed upon, and as to the seaman's being
entitled by statute to the highest rate of wages current.<a href="#note145" name="noteref145"><small>[145]</small></a> If a
seaman ships for a general coasting and trading voyage to different
ports in the United States, and the articles provide for no time or
place at which the voyage shall end, the seaman may leave at any time,
provided he does not do so under circumstances peculiarly inconvenient
to the other party.<a href="#note146" name="noteref146"><small>[146]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
If, however, the voyage is accurately described, and the wages
specified, the seaman cannot be admitted to show that his contract was
different from that contained in the articles.<a href="#note147" name="noteref147"><small>[147]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
It is no violation of the contract if the vessel departs from the
voyage described, by accident, necessity, or superior force.<a href="#note148" name="noteref148"><small>[148]</small></a>

Rendering on board. Refusal to proceed. Desertion or absence during the
voyage. Discharge.
</p>


<p>
<span class="sc">Rendering on board.</span>&#8212;If, after having signed the articles, and
after a time has been appointed for the seaman to render himself on
board, he neglects to appear, and an entry to that effect is made in
the log-book, he forfeits one day's pay for every hour of absence; and
if the ship is obliged to proceed without him, he forfeits a sum equal
to double his advance.<a href="#note149" name="noteref149"><small>[149]</small></a> These forfeitures apply to the commencement
of the voyage, and cannot be exacted unless a memorandum is made on the
articles, and an entry in full in the log-book. A justice of the peace
may, upon complaint of the master, issue a warrant to apprehend a
deserting seaman, and commit him to jail until the vessel is ready to
proceed upon her voyage. The master must, however, first show that the
contract has been signed, and that the seaman departed without leave,
and in violation of it.<a href="#note150" name="noteref150"><small>[150]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Refusal to proceed.</span>&#8212;If, after the voyage has begun, and
before the vessel has left the land, the first officer and a majority
of the crew shall agree that the vessel is unfit to proceed on the
voyage, either from fault or deficiency in hull, spars, rigging,
outfits, provisions, or crew, they may require the master to make the
nearest or most convenient port, and have the matter inquired into by
the district judge, or two justices of the peace, taking two or more of
the complainants before the judge. Thereupon the judge orders a survey,
and decides whether the vessel is to proceed, or stop and be repaired
and supplied; and both master and crew are bound by this decision. If
the seamen and mate shall have made this complaint without reason, and
from improper motives, they are liable to be charged with the expenses
attending it.<a href="#note151" name="noteref151"><small>[151]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
If, when the vessel is in a foreign port, the first or any other
officer and a majority of the crew shall make complaint, in writing, to
the consul, that the ship is unfit to proceed to sea, for any of the
above reasons, the consul shall order an examination, in the same
manner; and the decision of the consul shall bind all parties. If the
consul shall decide that the vessel was sent to sea in an unsuitable
condition, by neglect or design, the crew shall be entitled to their
discharge and three months' additional pay; but not if it was done by
accident or innocent mistake.<a href="#note152" name="noteref152"><small>[152]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
It is no justification for refusing to do duty and proceed upon the
voyage, that a new master has been substituted in place of the one
under whom the seaman originally shipped;<a href="#note153" name="noteref153"><small>[153]</small></a> and if a blank is left
for the name of the master, the seaman is supposed to ship under any
who may be appointed.<a href="#note154" name="noteref154"><small>[154]</small></a> The same rule applies to the substitution or
appointment of any other officer of the ship during the voyage.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Desertion or Absence during the Voyage.</span>&#8212;If, during the
voyage, the seaman absents himself without leave, for less than
forty-eight hours, and an entry thereof is made in full in the
log-book, he forfeits three days' pay for each day's absence. But if
the absence exceeds forty-eight hours, he forfeits all his wages then
due, and all his goods and chattels on board the vessel at the time,
and is liable to the owner in damages for the expense of hiring another
seaman.<a href="#note155" name="noteref155"><small>[155]</small></a> If he deserts within the limits of the United States, he
is liable to be arrested and committed to jail, until the vessel
sails.<a href="#note156" name="noteref156"><small>[156]</small></a> If he deserts or absents himself in a foreign port, the
consul is empowered to make use of the authorities of the place to
reclaim him. If, however, the consul is satisfied that the desertion
was caused by unusual or cruel treatment, the seaman may be discharged,
and shall receive three months' additional wages.<a href="#note157" name="noteref157"><small>[157]</small></a> It is not a
desertion for a seaman to leave his vessel for the purpose of procuring
necessary food, which has been refused on board; nor is a seaman liable
if the conduct of the master has been such as to make it dangerous for
him to remain on board,<a href="#note158" name="noteref158"><small>[158]</small></a> or if the shipping-articles have been
fraudulently altered.<a href="#note159" name="noteref159"><small>[159]</small></a> Even in a clear case of desertion, if the
party repents, and seeks to return to his duty within a reasonable
time, he is entitled to be received on board again, unless his previous
conduct had been such as would justify his discharge.<a href="#note160" name="noteref160"><small>[160]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
As to the effect of desertion upon wages, and what is desertion in such
cases, see the subject, "Wages affected by Desertion," Chapter XI.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Discharge.</span>&#8212;By referring to Chapter IV., "Master's Relation to
Crew," the seaman will find that, though the master has power to
discharge a seaman for gross and repeated misconduct, yet that this
right is closely watched, and any abuse of it is severely punished. He
will also find there a statement of his own rights and privileges, with
reference to a discharge. It has been seen that he may demand his
discharge of the consul, if the vessel is not fit to proceed, and is
not repaired, or if he has been cruelly and unjustifiably treated.<a href="#note161" name="noteref161"><small>[161]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
If a vessel has been so much injured that it is doubtful whether she
can be repaired, or the repairs cannot be made for a long time, during
which it would be a great expense to the owners to support the seamen
in a foreign country, it is held that the crew may be discharged, upon
the owners' paying their passage home, and their wages up to the time
of their arrival at the place of shipment.<a href="#note162" name="noteref162"><small>[162]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
As to discharge at the end of the voyage, see "Wages affected by
Desertion," Chapter XI.

Provisions. Sickness. Medicine-chest. Hospital money. Relief in foreign
ports. Protection.
</p>


<p>
<span class="sc">Provisions.</span>&#8212;For the benefit of seamen it has been enacted
that every vessel bound on a voyage across the Atlantic, shall have on
board, well secured under deck, at least sixty gallons of water, one
hundred pounds of wholesome ship bread, and one hundred pounds of
salted flesh meat, over and above the stores of master or passengers,
and the live stock. And if the crew of any vessel not so provided shall
be put upon short allowance of water, flesh, or bread, such seaman
shall recover from the master double wages for every day he was so
allowanced.<a href="#note163" name="noteref163"><small>[163]</small></a> The same rule applies to other voyages than those
across the Atlantic, and the amount of provisions stowed below must be
in proportion to the length of the voyage, compared with one across the
Atlantic.<a href="#note164" name="noteref164"><small>[164]</small></a> It also applies to seamen shipped in foreign ports, as
well as to those shipped in the United States.<a href="#note165" name="noteref165"><small>[165]</small></a> It has been thought
that if the articles enumerated cannot be procured, the master may
substitute other wholesome provisions; but it is doubtful whether even
this will free him from the penalty; at least it will not unless he can
show that it was impossible to procure them at the last port of
departure.<a href="#note166" name="noteref166"><small>[166]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
Besides this special enactment, a seaman may always recover damages of
a master who unnecessarily and wantonly deprives him of sufficient food
and nourishment.<a href="#note167" name="noteref167"><small>[167]</small></a> If, however, the short allowance is caused by
inevitable accident, without any fault of the master or owner, or is a
matter of fair discretion in a case of common danger, the master is not
liable. Another law of the United States provides that if any master or
other officer shall wilfully and without justifiable cause withhold
suitable food and nourishment from a seaman, he shall be fined not
exceeding $1000 and imprisoned not exceeding five years.<a href="#note168" name="noteref168"><small>[168]</small></a> The
master may at any time, at his discretion, put the crew upon an
allowance of water and eatables; but if it is a short allowance, he
must be able to give a justifying reason.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Sickness. Medicine-chest.</span>&#8212;Every vessel of one hundred and
fifty tons or upwards, navigated by ten or more persons in all, and
bound on a voyage beyond the United States, and every vessel of
seventy-five tons or upwards, navigated by six or more persons in the
whole, and bound from the United States to any port in the West Indies,
is required to have a chest of medicines, put up by an apothecary of
known reputation, and accompanied by directions for administering the
same. The chest must also be examined at least once a year, and
supplied with fresh medicines.<a href="#note169" name="noteref169"><small>[169]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
In case of dispute, the owner must prove the sufficiency of the
medicine-chest. It does not lie with the seaman to prove its
insufficiency.<a href="#note170" name="noteref170"><small>[170]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
If a vessel has a suitable medicine-chest on board, it would seem that
the ship is not to be charged with the medicines and medical advice
which a seaman may need. But the ship is still liable for the expenses
of his nursing, care, diet, and lodging.<a href="#note171" name="noteref171"><small>[171]</small></a> Accordingly, if a seaman
is put on shore at a hospital or elsewhere, for his cure, the ship is
chargeable with so much of the expense as is incurred for nursing,
care, diet, and lodging; and unless the owner can specify the items of
the charge, and show how much was for medical advice, and how much for
other expenses, he must pay the whole.<a href="#note172" name="noteref172"><small>[172]</small></a> The seaman is to be cured
at the expense of the ship, of a sickness or injury sustained in the
ship's service;<a href="#note173" name="noteref173"><small>[173]</small></a> but if he contracts a disease by his own fault or
vices, the ship is not chargeable.<a href="#note174" name="noteref174"><small>[174]</small></a> A sick seaman is entitled to
proper nursing, lodging, and diet. If these cannot be had, or are not
furnished on board the vessel, he is entitled to be taken on shore to a
hospital, or to some place where these can be obtained. It is often
attempted to be shown that the seaman was put on shore at his own
request. This is no defence. He is entitled to be put on shore if his
disease requires it; and it is seldom that proper care can be taken of
a seaman on board ship.<a href="#note175" name="noteref175"><small>[175]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
If a seaman requires further medicines and medical advice than the
chest and directions can give, and is not sent ashore, it would seem
that the ship ought to bear the expense; but this point has never been
decided.<a href="#note176" name="noteref176"><small>[176]</small></a> If the medicine-chest can furnish all he needs, the ship
is exempted.<a href="#note177" name="noteref177"><small>[177]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hospital Money.</span>&#8212;Every seaman must pay twenty cents a month,
out of his wages, for hospital money. This goes to the establishment
and support of hospitals for sick and disabled seamen.<a href="#note178" name="noteref178"><small>[178]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Relief in Foreign Ports.</span>&#8212;If a vessel is sold in a foreign
port and her crew discharged, or if a seaman is discharged with his own
consent, he can receive two months' extra wages of the consul, who must
obtain it of the master.<a href="#note179" name="noteref179"><small>[179]</small></a> This applies only to the voluntary sale
of the vessel, and not when the sale is rendered necessary by
shipwreck. If, however, after the disaster the vessel might have been
repaired at a reasonable expense and in a reasonable time, but the
owner chooses to sell, the two months' pay is due. To escape the
payment, the owner must show that he was obliged to sell.<a href="#note180" name="noteref180"><small>[180]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
It is also the duty of the consuls to provide subsistence and a passage
to the United States for any American seamen found destitute within
their districts. The seamen must, if able, do duty on board the vessel
in which they are sent home, according to their several abilities.<a href="#note181" name="noteref181"><small>[181]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
The crew of every vessel shall have the fullest liberty to lay their
complaints before the consul or commercial agent in any foreign port,
and shall in no respect be restrained or hindered therein by the master
or any officer, unless sufficient and valid objection exist against
their landing. In which case, if any seaman desire to see the consul,
the master must inform the consul of it forthwith; stating, in writing,
the reason why the seaman is not permitted to land, and that the consul
is desired to come on board. Whereupon the consul must proceed on board
and inquire into the causes of complaint.<a href="#note182" name="noteref182"><small>[182]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Protection.</span>&#8212;Every American seaman, upon applying to the
collector of the port from which he departs, and producing proof of his
citizenship, is entitled to a letter of protection. The collector may
charge for this twenty-five cents.<a href="#note183" name="noteref183"><small>[183]</small></a>

Punishment. Revolt and mutiny. Embezzlement. Piracy.
</p>


<p>
<span class="sc">Punishment.</span>&#8212;As to the right of the master to punish a seaman
by corporal chastisement, imprisonment on shore, confinement on board,
&#38;c., and the extent of that right, and the master's liability for
exceeding it,&#8212;the seaman is referred to Chapter IV., "The Master's
relation to the Crew," title, "Imprisonment" and "Punishment." He will
there see that the master possesses this right to a limited extent, and
that he is strictly answerable for the abuse of it. Disobedience of
orders, combinations to refuse duty, dishonest conduct, personal
insolence, and habitual negligence and backwardness, are all causes
which justify punishment in a greater or less degree.
</p>

<p>
The contract which a seaman makes with the master, is not like that of
a man who engages in any service on shore. It is somewhat military in
its nature.<a href="#note184" name="noteref184"><small>[184]</small></a> The master has great responsibilities resting upon
him, and is entitled to instant and implicit obedience. To ensure this,
regular and somewhat strict discipline must be preserved. The master,
also, cannot obtain assistance when at sea, as any one can who is in
authority upon land. He must depend upon the habits of faithful and
respectful discharge of duty which his crew have acquired, and if this
fails, he may resort to force. He is answerable for the safety of the
ship, and for the safe keeping and delivery of valuable cargoes, and in
almost all cases he is the first person to whom the owner of the vessel
and cargo will look for indemnity. Considering this, the seamen will
feel that it is not unreasonable that the master should have power to
protect himself and all for whom he acts, even by force if
necessary.<a href="#note185" name="noteref185"><small>[185]</small></a> A good seaman, who is able and willing to do his duty
faithfully and at all times, and treats his officers respectfully, will
seldom be abused; and if he is, the master is liable to him personally
in damages, and is also subject to be indicted by the government and
tried as a criminal. A seaman should be warned against taking the law
into his own hands. If the treatment he receives is unjustifiable, he
should still submit to it, if possible, until the voyage is up, or
until he arrives at some port where he can make complaint. If he is
conscious that he is not to blame, and an assault is made upon him
unjustifiably and with dangerous severity, he may defend himself; but
he should not attempt to punish the offender, or to inflict anything in
the way of retaliation.<a href="#note186" name="noteref186"><small>[186]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
In Chapter VI., title, "Mates," the reader will see how far any
inferior officer of a vessel may use force with a seaman.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Revolt and Mutiny.</span>&#8212;If any one or more of the crew of an
American vessel shall by fraud or force, or by threats or
intimidations, take the command of the vessel from the master or other
commanding officer, or resist or prevent him in the free and lawful
exercise of his authority, or transfer the command to any other person
not lawfully entitled to it; every person so offending, and his aiders
and abbettors, shall be deemed guilty of a revolt or mutiny and felony;
and shall be punished by fine not exceeding $2000, and by imprisonment
and confinement to hard labor not exceeding ten years, according to the
nature and aggravation of the offence.<a href="#note187" name="noteref187"><small>[187]</small></a> And if any seaman shall
endeavor to commit a revolt or mutiny, or shall combine with others on
board to make a revolt or mutiny, or shall solicit or incite any of the
crew to disobey or resist the lawful orders of the master or other
officer, or to refuse or neglect their proper duty on board, or shall
assemble with others in a riotous or mutinous manner, or shall
unlawfully confine the master or other commanding officer,&#8212;every
person committing any one or more of these offences shall be imprisoned
not exceeding five years, or fined not exceeding $1000, or both,
according to the nature and aggravation of the offence.<a href="#note188" name="noteref188"><small>[188]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
It will be seen that the first of these laws applies only to cases
where seamen actually throw off all authority, deprive the master of
his command, and assume the control themselves, which is to make a
revolt. The last is designed to punish endeavors and combinations to
make a revolt, which are not fully carried out.
</p>

<p>
Every little instance of disobedience, or insolent conduct, or even
force used against the master or other officer, will not be held a
revolt or an endeavor to make a revolt. There must be something showing
an intention to subvert the lawful authority of the master.<a href="#note189" name="noteref189"><small>[189]</small></a> It
does not excuse seamen, however, from this offence, that they confined
their refusal to one particular portion of their duty. If that duty was
lawfully required of them, it is equally a subversion of authority as
if they had refused all duty.<a href="#note190" name="noteref190"><small>[190]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
If the crew interfere by force or threats to prevent the infliction of
punishment for a gross offence, it is an endeavor to commit a
revolt.<a href="#note191" name="noteref191"><small>[191]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
To constitute the offence of confining the master, it is not necessary
that he should be forcibly secured in any particular place, or even
that his body should be seized and held; any act which deprives him of
his personal liberty in going about the ship, or prevents his doing his
duty freely, (if done with that intention,<a href="#note192" name="noteref192"><small>[192]</small></a>) is a confinement.<a href="#note193" name="noteref193"><small>[193]</small></a>
So is a threat of immediate bodily injury, if made in such a manner as
would reasonably intimidate a man of ordinary firmness.<a href="#note194" name="noteref194"><small>[194]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
In all these cases of revolt, mutiny, endeavors to commit the same, and
confinement of the master, it is to be remembered that the acts are
excusable if done from a sufficient justifying cause. The master may so
conduct himself as to justify the officers and crew in placing
restraints upon him, to prevent his committing acts which might
endanger the lives of all the persons on board. But an excuse of this
kind is received with great caution, and the crew should be well
assured of the necessity of such a step, before taking it, since they
run a great risk in so interfering.<a href="#note195" name="noteref195"><small>[195]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Embezzlement.</span>&#8212;If any of the crew steal, or appropriate, or by
gross negligence suffer to be stolen, any part of the cargo, or
anything belonging to the ship, they are responsible for the value of
everything stolen or appropriated.
</p>

<p>
It is necessary that the fraud, connivance, or negligence of a seaman
should be proved against him, before he can be charged with anything
lost or stolen; and in no case is an innocent man bound to contribute
towards a loss occasioned by the misconduct of another. If, however, it
is clearly proved that the whole crew were concerned, but one offender
is not known more than another, and the circumstances are such as to
affect all the crew, each man is to contribute to the loss, unless he
clears himself from the suspicion.<a href="#note196" name="noteref196"><small>[196]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Piracy.</span>&#8212;If the master or crew of a vessel shall, upon the
high seas, seize upon or rob the master or crew of another vessel; or
if they shall run away with the vessel committed to their charge, or
any goods to the amount of $50; or voluntarily yield them up to
pirates; or if the crew shall prevent the master by violence from
fighting in the defence of vessel or property; such conduct is piracy,
and punishable with death.<a href="#note197" name="noteref197"><small>[197]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
It is also piracy, and punishable with death, to be engaged in any
foreign country in kidnapping any negro or mulatto, or in decoying or
receiving them on board a vessel with the intention of making them
slaves.<a href="#note198" name="noteref198"><small>[198]</small></a>

Seamen's Wages.

<p class="subhead">
Affected by desertion or absence;&#8212;by misconduct;&#8212;by imprisonment;&#8212;by
capture;&#8212;by loss of vessel and interruption of voyage. Wages on an
illegal voyage. Wages affected by death or disability.
</p>


<p>
<span class="sc">Wages affected by Desertion or Absence.</span>&#8212;It has been seen that
if a seaman, at the commencement of the voyage, neglects to render
himself on board at the time appointed, and an entry thereof is made in
the log-book, he forfeits one day's pay for every hour's absence; and
if he shall wholly absent himself, so that the ship is obliged to go to
sea without him, he forfeits his advance and as much more.<a href="#note199" name="noteref199"><small>[199]</small></a> And if
at any time during the voyage he absents himself without leave, and
returns within forty-eight hours, he forfeits three days' pay for every
day's absence; but if he is absent more than forty-eight hours, he
forfeits all the wages then due him, and all his clothes and goods on
board at the time.<a href="#note200" name="noteref200"><small>[200]</small></a> These forfeitures cannot be exacted against the
seaman unless there is an entry made in the log-book on the same day
that he left, specifying the name of the seaman, and that he was absent
without leave.<a href="#note201" name="noteref201"><small>[201]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
But independently of these regulations, and without the necessity of
any entry, &#38;c., a seaman forfeits his wages for deserting the vessel,
or absenting himself wrongfully and without leave, by the general law
of all commercial nations.<a href="#note202" name="noteref202"><small>[202]</small></a> If, however, the seaman is absent
without fault of his own,<a href="#note203" name="noteref203"><small>[203]</small></a> or if he is obliged to desert by reason
of cruel treatment, want of food, or the like, he does not forfeit his
wages. But in such case, the seaman must prove that the treatment was
such that he could not remain without imminent danger to his life,
limbs, or health.<a href="#note204" name="noteref204"><small>[204]</small></a> If the voyage for which he shipped has been
abandoned, or there has been a gross and unnecessary deviation, he does
not forfeit his wages for leaving the vessel; but then the change of
voyage must have been actually determined upon and known to the
seaman.<a href="#note205" name="noteref205"><small>[205]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
Even if the seaman shall have clearly deserted without justifiable
cause, or absented himself more than forty-eight hours, yet, if he
shall offer to return and do his duty, the master must receive him,
unless his previous conduct would justify a discharge.<a href="#note206" name="noteref206"><small>[206]</small></a> And if he
is so received back, and does his duty faithfully for the rest of the
voyage, the forfeiture is considered as remitted, and he is entitled to
his wages for the whole voyage.<a href="#note207" name="noteref207"><small>[207]</small></a> If, however, the owner has
suffered any special damage from the wrongful absence of the seaman,
as, if the vessel has been detained, or a man hired in his place, all
such necessary expenses may be deducted from the wages.<a href="#note208" name="noteref208"><small>[208]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
A mere leaving of the vessel, though a wrongful absence, is not a
desertion, unless it is done with the intention to desert.<a href="#note209" name="noteref209"><small>[209]</small></a> A
seaman is bound to load and unload cargo in the course of the voyage if
required of him, and a refusal to do so is a refusal of duty.<a href="#note210" name="noteref210"><small>[210]</small></a> If
the voyage is at an end, according to the articles, and the vessel is
safely moored at the port of discharge, the seamen are still bound to
discharge the cargo if it is required of them. If they do not, their
refusal or neglect does not, however, work a forfeiture of all their
wages, but only makes them liable to a deduction, as compensation to
the owner for any damage he may have suffered.<a href="#note211" name="noteref211"><small>[211]</small></a> The custom in
almost all sea-ports of the United States is, to discharge the crew,
and not to require them to unload cargo at the end of the voyage. This
custom is so strong that if the owner or master wishes to retain the
crew, he must give them notice to that effect. Unless the crew are
distinctly told that they must remain and discharge cargo, they may
leave the vessel as soon as she is safely moored, or made fast. If they
are required to remain and discharge cargo, they make themselves liable
to a deduction from their wages for a neglect or refusal, but do not
forfeit them.<a href="#note212" name="noteref212"><small>[212]</small></a> The seaman must bear in mind, however, that this is
only when the voyage is at an end, and the ship is at the final port of
discharge. If he refuses to load or unload at any port in the course of
the voyage, and before it is up, according to the articles, he does so
at the risk of forfeiting all his wages.<a href="#note213" name="noteref213"><small>[213]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
The master and owners of a vessel are allowed ten days after the voyage
is up, before a suit can be brought against them for the wages of the
crew.<a href="#note214" name="noteref214"><small>[214]</small></a> This is in order to give them time to settle all accounts
and discover delinquencies. If the crew are retained to unload, then
the ten days begin to run from the time the vessel is completely
unloaded. But if the crew are not retained for this purpose, but are
discharged and allowed to leave the vessel, then the ten days begin to
run from the day they are discharged.<a href="#note215" name="noteref215"><small>[215]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Wages affected by Misconduct.</span>&#8212;A seaman may forfeit his wages
by gross misconduct; and if not forfeited, he may be liable to have a
deduction made from them, for any damage caused to the owner by such
misconduct. To create a forfeiture, his misbehavior must be gross and
aggravated.<a href="#note216" name="noteref216"><small>[216]</small></a> A single act of disobedience, or a single neglect of
duty, will not deprive him of his wages.<a href="#note217" name="noteref217"><small>[217]</small></a> A refusal to do duty in a
moment of high excitement caused by punishment will not forfeit wages,
unless followed by obstinate perseverance in such refusal.<a href="#note218" name="noteref218"><small>[218]</small></a> Where
<i>drunkenness</i> is habitual and gross, so as to create a general
incapacity to perform duty, it is a ground of forfeiture of wages. But
occasional acts of drunkenness, if the seaman in other respects
performs his duty, will not deprive him of his wages.<a href="#note219" name="noteref219"><small>[219]</small></a> In this, as
in all cases of neglect, disobedience, or wilful misconduct, which do
not create a forfeiture, a deduction may be made if the owner has
suffered any loss.<a href="#note220" name="noteref220"><small>[220]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
In one instance a forfeiture of one half of a seaman's wages was
decreed, in consequence of his striking the master. He did not forfeit
the whole, because he had been otherwise punished.<a href="#note221" name="noteref221"><small>[221]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
If the seaman is imprisoned for misconduct, he does not forfeit the
wages that accrued during his confinement, nor, what amounts to the
same thing, is he bound to pay those of a person hired in his place
during his imprisonment.<a href="#note222" name="noteref222"><small>[222]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
If the crime of a seaman is against the laws of the United States, and
too great for the master's authority to punish, he must be confined and
brought home to trial. But this does not forfeit his wages, though any
loss or damage to the owner may be deducted.<a href="#note223" name="noteref223"><small>[223]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
In all cases of forfeiture of wages for misconduct, it is only the
wages due at the time of the misconduct that are lost. The wages
subsequently earned are not affected by any previous misbehavior.<a href="#note224" name="noteref224"><small>[224]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
If a seaman or officer is evidently incapable of doing the duty he
shipped for, he may be put upon other duty, and a reasonable deduction
may be made from his wages.<a href="#note225" name="noteref225"><small>[225]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Wages affected by Imprisonment.</span>&#8212;If a seaman is imprisoned by
a warrant from a judge or justice of the peace, within the limits of
the United States, for desertion or refusal to render himself on board,
he is liable to pay the cost of his commitment and support in jail, as
well as the wages of any person hired in his place.<a href="#note226" name="noteref226"><small>[226]</small></a> So, if a
seaman is imprisoned in a foreign port by the authorities of the place
for a breach of their laws, the costs and loss to the owner may be
deducted from his wages; but not so if he is imprisoned at the request
of the master.<a href="#note227" name="noteref227"><small>[227]</small></a> The right of the master to imprison at all is a
doubtful one, and dangerous of exercise; and if he does resort to it,
he can never charge the expenses to the seamen, nor deduct their wages
during imprisonment.<a href="#note228" name="noteref228"><small>[228]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Wages affected by Capture.</span>&#8212;If a neutral ship is captured, it
is the right and duty of the seamen to remain by the vessel until the
case is finally settled.<a href="#note229" name="noteref229"><small>[229]</small></a> If she is liberated, they are then
entitled to their wages for the whole voyage; and if freight is
decreed, they are entitled to their wages for as much of the voyage as
freight is given.<a href="#note230" name="noteref230"><small>[230]</small></a> And if at any future time the owners recover the
vessel, or her value, upon appeal or by treaty, they are liable for
wages.<a href="#note231" name="noteref231"><small>[231]</small></a>] In order to secure his wages in these cases, the seaman
must remain by the vessel until her sale or condemnation, and the
master cannot oblige him to take his discharge.<a href="#note232" name="noteref232"><small>[232]</small></a> The condemnation
or sale of the vessel puts an end to his contract. If he leaves before
the condemnation or sale, with the master's consent, he does not lose
his chance of recovering his wages.<a href="#note233" name="noteref233"><small>[233]</small></a> Even if the vessel is
condemned, and the owner never recovers the vessel or its value, yet
the seaman is entitled to his wages up to the last port of delivery,
and for half the time she lay there.<a href="#note234" name="noteref234"><small>[234]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Wages affected by Loss of Vessel or Interruption of
Voyage.</span>&#8212;If a vessel meets with a disaster, it is the duty of the
crew to remain by her so long as they can do it with safety, and to
exert themselves to the utmost of their ability to save as much as
possible of the vessel and cargo.<a href="#note235" name="noteref235"><small>[235]</small></a> If they abandon the vessel
unnecessarily, they forfeit all their wages; and if their leaving was
necessary and justifiable, yet they lose their wages except up to the
last port of delivery and for half the time the vessel was lying there,
or for so long as she was engaged with the outward cargo.<a href="#note236" name="noteref236"><small>[236]</small></a> This
rule may seem hard, but its object is to secure the services of the
crew in case of a disaster. If by their exertions any parts of the
vessel or cargo are saved, they are entitled to wages, and an extra sum
for salvage.<a href="#note237" name="noteref237"><small>[237]</small></a> If the vessel is abandoned and nothing is saved, they
lose their wages, except up to the last port of delivery and for half
the time the vessel was lying there.<a href="#note238" name="noteref238"><small>[238]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
The general rule is, that a seaman's wages are secure to him whenever
the vessel has earned any freight, whatever may afterwards happen. And
a vessel earns freight at every port where she delivers any cargo. For
the benefit of seamen a vessel is held to earn freight whenever she
goes to a port under a contract for freight, though she go in
ballast.<a href="#note239" name="noteref239"><small>[239]</small></a> A seaman also secures his wages wherever the ship might
have earned freight but for the agreement or other act of the
owner.<a href="#note240" name="noteref240"><small>[240]</small></a> If a vessel is on a trading voyage from port to port, and
is lost on the homeward passage, wages would probably be allowed for
the outward passage, and for half the time she was engaged in trading
with the old or new cargoes; the trading and going from port to port
being considered the same as though she had been lying in port all the
time, and discharging and receiving cargo. Or else, wages would be
given up to the last port at which she took in any return cargo, and
for half the time she was lying there.<a href="#note241" name="noteref241"><small>[241]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
These rules apply only to cases where the voyage is broken up by
inevitable accidents, as by perils of the seas, capture, war or
superior force. If the voyage is broken up by the fault of the seamen,
they lose all their wages. If, on the other hand, the seamen are
compelled to leave, or the voyage is broken up by the fault of the
master or owner, as by cruel treatment, want of provisions, or the
like, the crew would be justly entitled to wages for the whole voyage
contracted for. If the vessel is sold, or the voyage altered or
abandoned by the master or owner, not from inevitable necessity, but
for their own interest and convenience, then the crew are entitled, by
statute, to wages for all the time they were on board, and two months'
extra pay.<a href="#note242" name="noteref242"><small>[242]</small></a> And, by the general law, they would always receive some
extra wages as a compensation for the loss of the voyage, and as a
means of supporting themselves and procuring a passage home; or,
perhaps, full wages for the voyage.<a href="#note243" name="noteref243"><small>[243]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Wages on an Illegal Voyage.</span>&#8212;A seaman has no remedy for his
wages upon an illegal voyage; as, for instance, in the slave
trade.<a href="#note244" name="noteref244"><small>[244]</small></a> Wages have, however, been allowed, where it was proved that
the seaman was innocent of all knowledge of, or participation in, the
illegal voyage.<a href="#note245" name="noteref245"><small>[245]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Wages affected by Death or Disability.</span>&#8212;If a seaman dies
during the voyage, wages are to be paid up to the time of his
death.<a href="#note246" name="noteref246"><small>[246]</small></a> A seaman is entitled to all his wages during sickness, and
during any time he was disabled from performing duty. But if his
sickness or disability is brought on by his own fault, as by vice or
wilful misconduct, a deduction may be made for the loss of his
services.<a href="#note247" name="noteref247"><small>[247]</small></a> So, where the death of a seaman was caused by his own
unjustifiable and wrongful acts, his wages were held forfeited.<a href="#note248" name="noteref248"><small>[248]</small></a> If
a seaman, at the time he ships, is laboring under a disease which
incapacitates or is likely to incapacitate him during the voyage, and
he conceals the same, no wages will be allowed him, or a deduction will
be made from them, according to the nature of the case.<a href="#note249" name="noteref249"><small>[249]</small></a> If, in
consequence of sickness, a seaman is left at a foreign port, he is
still entitled to wages for the whole voyage.<a href="#note250" name="noteref250"><small>[250]</small></a>

SEAMEN&#8212;CONCLUDED.

<p class="subhead">
Recovery of wages. Interest on wages. Salvage.
</p>


<p>
<span class="sc">Recovery of Wages.</span>&#8212;A seaman has a threefold remedy for his
wages: first, against the master; secondly, against the owners; and,
thirdly, against the ship itself and the freight earned.<a href="#note251" name="noteref251"><small>[251]</small></a> He may
pursue any one of these, or he may pursue them all at the same time in
courts of admiralty. He has what is called a <i>lien</i> upon the ship
for his wages; that is, he has a right, at any time, to seize the
vessel by a process of law, and retain it until his claim is paid, or
otherwise decided upon by the court. This lien does not cease upon the
sailing of the ship on another voyage; and the vessel may be taken
notwithstanding there is a new master and different owners.<a href="#note252" name="noteref252"><small>[252]</small></a> A
seaman does not lose his lien upon the ship by lapse of time. He may
take the ship whenever he finds her; though he must not allow a long
time to elapse if he has had any opportunity of enforcing his claim,
lest it should be considered a stale demand. In common law courts a
suit cannot be brought for wages after six years have expired since
they became due. This is not the case in courts of admiralty.<a href="#note253" name="noteref253"><small>[253]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
The lien of the seaman for wages takes precedence of every other lien
or claim upon the vessel.<a href="#note254" name="noteref254"><small>[254]</small></a> The seaman's wages must be first paid,
even if they take up the whole value of the ship or freight. The wreck
of a ship is bound for the wages, and the rule in admiralty is, that a
seaman's claim on the ship is good so long as there is a plank of her
left.<a href="#note255" name="noteref255"><small>[255]</small></a> If, after capture and condemnation, the ship itself is not
restored, but the owners are indemnified in money, the seaman's lien
attaches to such proceeds.<a href="#note256" name="noteref256"><small>[256]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
Besides this lien upon the ship, the seaman has also a lien upon the
freight earned, and upon the cargo.<a href="#note257" name="noteref257"><small>[257]</small></a> He may also sue the owner or
master, or both, personally. They are, however, answerable
<i>personally</i> only for the wages earned while the ship was in their
own hands.<a href="#note258" name="noteref258"><small>[258]</small></a> But a suit may be brought against the <i>ship</i> after
she has changed owners.<a href="#note259" name="noteref259"><small>[259]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
A seaman does not lose his lien upon the vessel by taking an order upon
the owner.<a href="#note260" name="noteref260"><small>[260]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
After a vessel is abandoned to the underwriters, they become liable for
the seamen's wages, from the time of the abandonment.<a href="#note261" name="noteref261"><small>[261]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
If, at the end of the voyage, the crew are discharged and not retained
to unload, their wages are due immediately;<a href="#note262" name="noteref262"><small>[262]</small></a> but they cannot sue in
admiralty until ten days after the day of discharge.<a href="#note263" name="noteref263"><small>[263]</small></a> If they are
retained to unload, then the owner is allowed ten days from the time
the cargo is fully discharged. If, however, the vessel is about to
proceed to sea before the ten days will elapse, or before the cargo
will be unloaded, the seaman may attach the vessel immediately.<a href="#note264" name="noteref264"><small>[264]</small></a> If
the owner retains his crew while the cargo is unloading, he must unload
it within a reasonable time. Fifteen working days has frequently been
held a reasonable time for unloading, and the ten days have been
allowed to run from that time.<a href="#note265" name="noteref265"><small>[265]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
The longest time allowed by law for unloading vessels is twenty days,
if over 300 tons, and ten days, if under that tonnage. Probably seamen
would not be held bound to the vessel for a longer time than is thus
allowed by law for unloading.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Interest on Wages.</span>&#8212;In suits for seamen's wages, interest is
allowed from the time of the demand; and if no demand is proved, then
from the time of the commencement of the suit.<a href="#note266" name="noteref266"><small>[266]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Salvage.</span>&#8212;If a vessel is picked up at sea abandoned, or in
distress, and any of the crew of the vessel which falls in with her go
on board, and are the means of saving her, or of bringing her into
port, they are entitled to salvage.<a href="#note267" name="noteref267"><small>[267]</small></a> In this case, all the crew who
are ready and willing to engage in the service are entitled to a share
of the reward, although they may not have gone on board the wreck.<a href="#note268" name="noteref268"><small>[268]</small></a>
The reason is, that where all are ready to go, and a selection is made,
there would be injustice and favoritism in allowing any one the
privilege more than another. Besides, those who remain have an extra
duty to perform in consequence of the others having gone on board the
wreck.<a href="#note269" name="noteref269"><small>[269]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
Crews are not ordinarily entitled to salvage for services performed on
board their own vessel, whatever may have been their perils or
hardships, or the gallantry of their services in saving ship and
cargo;<a href="#note270" name="noteref270"><small>[270]</small></a> for some degree of extra exertion to meet perils and
accidents, is within the scope of a seaman's duty. In case of
shipwreck, however, where, by the general law, wages are forfeited, the
court will allow salvage, considering it as in the nature of wages due.
In one instance salvage was refused to a part of a crew who rescued the
ship from the rest who had mutinied; for this was held to be no more
than their duty.<a href="#note271" name="noteref271"><small>[271]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
Yet seamen may entitle themselves to salvage for services performed on
board their own vessel, if clearly beyond the line of their regular
duty; as, when the crew rise and rescue the vessel from the enemy after
she has been taken.<a href="#note272" name="noteref272"><small>[272]</small></a> So, where a ship was abandoned at sea, and one
or two men voluntarily remained behind, and by great exertions brought
her into port.<a href="#note273" name="noteref273"><small>[273]</small></a> If an apprentice is a salvor, he, and not his
master, is entitled to the salvage.<a href="#note274" name="noteref274"><small>[274]</small></a> If one set of men go on board
a wreck, but fall into distress and are relieved by others, they do not
lose their claim for salvage, but each set of salvors shares according
